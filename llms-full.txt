## Medical Services

### Comprehensive Blood Panels — $285
60+ biomarkers analyzed including:
- Hormones: Total testosterone, free testosterone, estradiol, progesterone, DHEA-S, thyroid panel (TSH, free T3, free T4)
- Metabolic: Fasting glucose, HbA1c, insulin, lipid panel, ApoB
- Inflammation: CRP, homocysteine
- Nutrients: Vitamin D, B12, ferritin, iron panel, magnesium
- Organ function: Complete metabolic panel, liver enzymes, kidney function

Why it matters: Standard primary care panels test 10-15 markers. We test 60+ because optimization requires seeing the full picture—not just checking for disease.

### DEXA Body Composition Scan — $150
Medical-grade body composition analysis measuring:
- Total body fat percentage and distribution
- Lean muscle mass by region (arms, legs, trunk)
- Bone mineral density (osteoporosis screening)
- Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) — the dangerous fat around organs
- Android/gynoid fat ratio

Equipment: Hologic Horizon scanner (gold standard in research and clinical settings)
- 128 ceramic detectors
- OnePass fan beam technology
- Under 3 minutes for whole body scan
- Precision exceeds ISCD standards by 4x
- Supports patients up to 500 lbs

Why DEXA over InBody or home scales: DEXA is the only method that directly measures body composition with X-ray technology. Bioelectrical impedance (InBody, home scales) estimates composition based on water content and can vary 5-10% based on hydration, meals, and time of day.

### Performance Baseline Bundle — $405 (save $30)
DEXA scan + comprehensive blood panel together. Best starting point for anyone serious about optimization.

### Men's Hormone Optimization — $208/month
Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) and hormone optimization for men experiencing:
- Low energy and fatigue
- Decreased libido
- Brain fog and poor concentration
- Mood changes, irritability, depression
- Difficulty building or maintaining muscle
- Increased body fat, especially abdominal
- Poor sleep quality

What's included:
- Ongoing medical oversight and provider access
- Personalized protocol design
- 2 DEXA scans per year
- Comprehensive labs every 6 months
- 1 vitamin shot per month
- Dosing adjustments as needed

Treatment options:
- Testosterone cypionate injections
- Testosterone cream
- Enclomiphene (fertility-preserving alternative)
- HCG (for fertility preservation)

Safety monitoring: We track hematocrit, PSA, lipids, and estradiol regularly to ensure treatment remains safe.

### Women's Hormone Optimization — $208/month
Bioidentical hormone replacement therapy (BHRT) for women experiencing:
- Perimenopause and menopause symptoms
- Hot flashes, night sweats
- Sleep disturbances
- Mood changes, anxiety, depression
- Brain fog and memory issues
- Low libido
- Vaginal dryness
- Weight gain, especially around midsection
- Bone density concerns

What's included:
- Ongoing medical oversight and provider access
- Personalized protocol design
- 2 DEXA scans per year
- Comprehensive labs every 6 months
- 1 vitamin shot per month
- Dosing adjustments as needed

Treatment options:
- Estradiol (patch, cream, or pellets)
- Progesterone (oral or cream)
- Testosterone (yes, women need it too—for energy, libido, and muscle)
- DHEA
- Thyroid optimization

We use bioidentical hormones—molecularly identical to what your body produces—not synthetic versions.

### Weight Loss Program (GLP-1) — $405/month
Medical weight loss using GLP-1 medications with a focus on muscle preservation:
- Semaglutide (same active ingredient as Ozempic/Wegovy)
- Tirzepatide (same active ingredient as Mounjaro/Zepbound)

What's included:
- GLP-1 medication
- Medical oversight and provider access
- DEXA tracking to ensure you're losing fat, not muscle
- Lab monitoring
- Dosing adjustments
- Nutrition guidance

Why we track body composition: The scale doesn't tell the whole story. Rapid weight loss often includes muscle loss, which hurts metabolism and long-term health. We use DEXA to ensure you're losing fat and preserving (or building) muscle.

### Prescription + Oversight Program — $105/month
For patients whose insurance covers GLP-1 or hormone medications:
- We write the prescription and send to your pharmacy
- Medical oversight and monitoring
- Lab work as needed
- Dosing guidance
- Provider access for questions

### Peptides
Therapeutic peptides guided by labs and goals (all FDA-compliant):
- Sermorelin ($250/month): Growth hormone stimulant. Anti-aging, recovery, body composition.
- PT-141 ($250/month): Sexual health peptide. Improves desire and arousal for men and women.
- Tesamorelin ($300/month): Growth hormone-releasing hormone analog. Reduces visceral fat.

We do NOT offer BPC-157 or TB-500 (on the FDA do not compound list).

### Daily Tadalafil
Daily low-dose tadalafil (2.5-5mg) for benefits beyond erectile dysfunction:
- Improved blood flow and vasodilation body-wide
- Prostate and urinary health (FDA-approved for BPH)
- Endothelial function and cardiovascular support
- Mild blood pressure reduction (3-5 mmHg)
- Emerging evidence for insulin sensitivity
- Often combined with TRT for comprehensive men's health optimization
- Contraindicated with nitrates

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General

**What makes Moonshot different from a regular doctor?**
Primary care is designed for sick care—treating problems after they appear. We focus on optimization—measuring early, identifying trends, and intervening before problems develop. We also spend more time with patients (30-60 min visits, not 7 minutes) and test far more comprehensively (60+ biomarkers vs 10-15).

**Do you accept insurance?**
- Rehab services: We accept Blue Cross Blue Shield PPO
- Medical services: Cash-pay only

Insurance doesn't cover optimization. It's designed for sick care—waiting until something is broken to act. Our goal is to take you from "normal" to optimal, not just react when there's a problem. This model lets us spend more time with you, order the right tests, and focus on what actually moves the needle.

**Do you accept HSA/FSA?**
Yes, HSA and FSA are accepted for most services.

### Hormone Therapy

**Is testosterone therapy (TRT) safe?**
When properly monitored, testosterone therapy has a strong safety profile. We monitor hematocrit, PSA, lipids, and estradiol regularly and adjust protocols as needed. The key is proper dosing and ongoing monitoring—not a prescription and a handshake.

**Will TRT affect my fertility?**
Standard TRT can suppress sperm production. If fertility is a concern, we offer protocols using HCG or enclomiphene that can help preserve fertility while optimizing hormones.

**What's the difference between TRT and enclomiphene?**
TRT replaces testosterone directly. Enclomiphene stimulates your body to produce more testosterone naturally by blocking estrogen feedback at the pituitary. Enclomiphene preserves fertility and testicular function but may not achieve the same testosterone levels as TRT. We help you decide which is right based on your goals, labs, and fertility plans.

**Is hormone replacement therapy safe for women?**
Yes, when properly prescribed and monitored. The 2002 WHI study created fear around HRT, but it studied synthetic hormones (Premarin, Provera) in older women, not bioidentical hormones in perimenopausal women. Subsequent research shows bioidentical hormones, started around menopause, are safe and protective for most women.

**Do women need testosterone?**
Yes. Women produce testosterone naturally (just less than men), and it declines with age. Low testosterone in women contributes to fatigue, low libido, difficulty building muscle, and brain fog. We prescribe it at physiologic doses appropriate for women.

### Weight Loss

**How do GLP-1 medications work?**
GLP-1s (semaglutide, tirzepatide) mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar. They reduce hunger, increase satiety, and help your body regulate blood sugar more effectively. Combined with proper nutrition and monitoring, they can produce significant, sustainable weight loss.

**Will I lose muscle on GLP-1s?**
Rapid weight loss—with or without medication—can include muscle loss. That's why we track body composition with DEXA, not just scale weight. We adjust nutrition and monitor to ensure you're losing fat while preserving muscle.

**What happens when I stop GLP-1 medication?**
Without lifestyle changes, weight often returns. That's why we focus on building sustainable habits during treatment and using DEXA to ensure you're building or maintaining muscle (which supports metabolism).

### DEXA & Labs

**How often should I get a DEXA scan?**
For most optimization patients, every 6 months is ideal to track progress. More frequently if you're making significant body composition changes. Our hormone programs include 2 DEXA scans per year.

**Why do you test so many biomarkers?**
Standard panels are designed to detect disease, not optimize health. You can be "normal" on a basic panel and still have suboptimal testosterone, elevated insulin, low vitamin D, or high ApoB—all of which affect how you feel and your long-term health. We test comprehensively because optimization requires the full picture.

### TRT vs Steroids: Key Points
The misconception that TRT equals steroids is one of the biggest barriers to men seeking treatment. The differences are fundamental:

**Bioidentical vs Synthetic:**
- TRT uses testosterone cypionate or enanthate—bioidentical molecules that match what your body naturally produces
- Anabolic steroids are synthetic derivatives modified for enhanced muscle-building (nandrolone, trenbolone, stanozolol, etc.)
- These modifications create different receptor binding profiles and metabolic pathways

**Dose Comparison:**
- TRT: 100-200mg/week to achieve normal physiologic levels (500-900 ng/dL)
- Steroid cycles: 500-2000+ mg/week, often stacking multiple compounds
- That's 5-20x the physiologic dose

**Why Steroids Damage the Heart:**
1. LDL cholesterol increases dramatically (often 2-3x)
2. HDL cholesterol suppressed (sometimes below 20 mg/dL)
3. Left ventricular hypertrophy from chronic high doses
4. Arterial stiffening and endothelial dysfunction
5. Chronic inflammation and oxidative stress
6. Synthetic compounds metabolize differently, creating additional cardiac stress

**TRT's Safety Profile:**
When properly monitored at physiologic doses, TRT:
- Maintains or improves lipid profiles
- Does not cause pathological cardiac remodeling
- Requires monitoring of hematocrit, PSA, and estradiol
- Has been studied extensively with a strong safety record

GETTING STARTED 
## What to Expect: 
Your First Visit 

How to prepare, what we test, and what happens after your initial consultation. 
### Your Path to Optimization 

Your first visit to Moonshot Medical isn't a quick prescription mill appointment. We take the time to understand your symptoms, goals, and history—then run comprehensive labs to get the full picture before recommending treatment. 

Here's exactly what to expect at each step of the process. 
### Before Your Visit 
#### Booking Your Consultation 

Schedule online or call our office. We'll send you intake forms to complete before your appointment. These cover your medical history, current medications, symptoms, and goals. 
#### What to Bring 

- Photo ID 
- List of current medications and supplements 
- Any recent lab results (within 6 months) 
- List of symptoms you're experiencing 
#### Fasting Requirements 

**Fast for 10-12 hours **before your appointment if we're running labs. Water, black coffee, and plain tea are fine. Fasting ensures accurate readings for glucose, insulin, and lipid panels. 
### The Consultation 
#### 1. Symptom Review 

We start by discussing your symptoms in detail. Fatigue, weight changes, mood issues, sleep problems, libido, brain fog, recovery—everything is relevant. We want to understand not just what you're experiencing, but when it started and how it's affecting your life. 
#### 2. Medical History 

We review your complete medical history, family history, and any previous treatments you've tried. This helps us identify patterns and rule out conditions that might need additional attention. 
#### 3. Goals Discussion 

What does "feeling better" look like for you? Are you focused on energy? Body composition? Athletic performance? Sleep? Clarity? We tailor our approach to your specific goals, not a one-size-fits-all protocol. 
#### 4. Physical Assessment 

Depending on your situation, we may check vital signs, body composition, and other relevant physical markers. 
### Comprehensive Lab Work 

We run extensive labs—far more than a typical primary care visit. This isn't about checking a box; it's about getting the complete picture. 
#### Hormone Panel 

- Total and Free Testosterone 
- Estradiol (E2) 
- DHEA-S 
- Progesterone (women) 
- SHBG (Sex Hormone Binding Globulin) 
- LH and FSH 
- Prolactin 
#### Thyroid Panel 

- TSH 
- Free T3 and Free T4 
- Reverse T3 
- Thyroid Antibodies (TPO, Thyroglobulin) 
#### Metabolic Markers 

- Fasting Glucose and Insulin 
- HbA1c 
- Lipid Panel (Total, LDL, HDL, Triglycerides) 
- Comprehensive Metabolic Panel 
- Liver Enzymes (AST, ALT) 
#### Additional Markers 

- Complete Blood Count (CBC) 
- Vitamin D 
- B12 
- Ferritin and Iron Studies 
- hsCRP (inflammation marker) 
- PSA (men over 40) 
### After Your Labs 
#### Results Review (3-7 Days) 

Labs typically take 3-7 days to process. Once they're in, we schedule a follow-up (in-person or virtual) to review your results in detail . We don't just look at whether you're "in range"—we look at where you are within the range and what optimal levels look like for your age and goals. 
#### Treatment Planning 

Based on your symptoms, goals, and lab results, we create a personalized treatment plan. This might include hormone optimization, lifestyle modifications, supplements, or medications. We explain the rationale for each recommendation and answer all your questions. 
#### Informed Consent 

Before starting any treatment, we review benefits, risks, and alternatives. You'll understand exactly what you're taking, why, and what to expect. No surprises. 
### Typical Timeline Day 1 Initial consultation + blood draw Day 3-7 Lab results ready Day 7-10 Results review + treatment plan Week 2 Begin treatment (if applicable) Week 6-8 Follow-up labs to assess response Ongoing Regular monitoring + optimization 
### Ongoing Care 

Treatment doesn't end after your first prescription. We follow up regularly to monitor your response, adjust dosing, and recheck labs. Most patients have follow-up labs at 6-8 weeks, then every 3-6 months once stable. 

You'll have direct access to our clinical team for questions between visits. We're partners in your health, not a one-and-done prescription service. 
### What Makes Us Different 
#### Comprehensive Testing 

We run extensive panels, not just the basics. You can't optimize what you haven't measured. 
#### Time With Providers 

Your consultation isn't rushed. We take the time to understand your situation and answer your questions. 
#### Optimal vs Normal 

"Normal" ranges include everyone from sick to healthy. We aim for optimal levels based on your goals. 
#### Ongoing Optimization 

Regular follow-ups and adjustments ensure you're getting the best possible results.

### Understanding Your Blood Results
URL: https://moonshotmp.com/learn/understanding-blood-results/

DIAGNOSTICS 
## Understanding Your 
Blood Results 

What your biomarkers mean, optimal vs normal ranges, and the key patterns to watch for. 
### Beyond "Normal" Ranges 

When your doctor says your labs are "normal," what does that actually mean? Normal ranges are set so that 95% of the population falls within them—including people who are sick, sedentary, or metabolically unhealthy. 

**"Normal" doesn't mean optimal. **A testosterone level of 300 ng/dL is technically "normal" for a 35-year-old man, but it's the same level you'd expect in an 80-year-old. You can be in the "normal" range and still feel terrible. 

This guide will help you understand what your numbers actually mean and what optimal levels look like. 
### Hormone Markers 
#### Total Testosterone 

Lab "Normal" Range (Men) 

264–916 ng/dL 

Optimal Range (Men) 

600–900 ng/dL 

**What it measures: **Total amount of testosterone in blood, including both bound and unbound. 

**Why it matters: **Testosterone affects energy, mood, libido, muscle mass, fat distribution, bone density, and cognitive function. 

**Key insight: **Where you fall within the range matters. A level of 350 might be "normal" but can cause significant symptoms. Context matters—age, symptoms, and free testosterone levels all factor in. 
#### Free Testosterone 

Lab "Normal" Range (Men) 

9–30 pg/mL 

Optimal Range (Men) 

15–25 pg/mL 

**What it measures: **The testosterone not bound to proteins—the portion that's actually available for your body to use. 

**Key insight: **You can have "normal" total testosterone but low free testosterone if SHBG (sex hormone binding globulin) is high. Free T is often more clinically relevant than total T. 
#### Estradiol (E2) 

Lab "Normal" Range (Men) 

10–40 pg/mL 

Optimal Range (Men) 

20–35 pg/mL 

**What it measures: **The primary estrogen hormone. Men need some estrogen for bone health, libido, and cardiovascular function. 

**Key insight: **Both high and low estradiol cause problems. High E2 can cause water retention, mood issues, and gynecomastia. Low E2 causes joint pain, low libido, and mood issues. Balance with testosterone matters. 
#### SHBG (Sex Hormone Binding Globulin) 

Lab "Normal" Range 

10–57 nmol/L 

Optimal Range 

20–40 nmol/L 

**What it measures: **A protein that binds to sex hormones. High SHBG = less free hormone available. 

**Key insight: **High SHBG can make your total testosterone look fine while you're functionally low. Elevated by: aging, high estrogen, liver issues, hyperthyroidism. Lowered by: insulin resistance, obesity, hypothyroidism. 
### Thyroid Markers 
#### TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone) 

Lab "Normal" Range 

0.4–4.5 mIU/L 

Optimal Range 

1.0–2.0 mIU/L 

**What it measures: **A pituitary hormone that tells your thyroid to produce hormones. Counterintuitively, HIGH TSH = LOW thyroid function (your body is screaming for more thyroid hormone). 

**Key insight: **Many people with TSH of 3-4 have subclinical hypothyroidism—technically "normal" but experiencing fatigue, weight gain, and brain fog. TSH alone doesn't tell the full story; you need Free T3 and T4 as well. For a deeper look at thyroid optimization , see our full guide. 
#### Free T3 

Lab "Normal" Range 

2.3–4.2 pg/mL 

Optimal Range 

3.0–4.0 pg/mL 

**What it measures: **The active thyroid hormone. T4 converts to T3, which is what your cells actually use. 

**Key insight: **Many people have normal T4 but poor conversion to T3. Stress, nutrient deficiencies (selenium, zinc, iron), and inflammation can all impair conversion. Free T3 is often the most clinically relevant thyroid marker. 
#### Free T4 

Lab "Normal" Range 

0.8–1.8 ng/dL 

Optimal Range 

1.2–1.5 ng/dL 

**What it measures: **The storage form of thyroid hormone. Your body converts T4 to T3 as needed. 

**Key insight: **If TSH and T4 look normal but you still have symptoms, check T3 and reverse T3. Poor T4-to-T3 conversion is common. 
### Metabolic Markers 
#### Fasting Glucose 

Lab "Normal" Range 

65–99 mg/dL 

Optimal Range 

70–85 mg/dL 

**What it measures: **Blood sugar after 10-12 hours of fasting. 

**Key insight: **A fasting glucose of 95 is "normal" but indicates insulin resistance is likely developing. By the time glucose hits 100+, you've had insulin problems for years. Pair with fasting insulin for the full picture. 
#### Fasting Insulin 

Lab "Normal" Range 

2–25 μIU/mL 

Optimal Range 

3–8 μIU/mL 

**What it measures: **How much insulin your pancreas produces to control blood sugar. 

**Key insight: **Often the FIRST marker to become abnormal in metabolic dysfunction—years before glucose rises. High fasting insulin (above 10) with normal glucose = insulin resistance. Your body is working overtime to keep glucose normal. 
#### HbA1c (Hemoglobin A1c) 

Lab "Normal" Range 

4.0–5.6% 

Optimal Range 

4.5–5.2% 

**What it measures: **Average blood sugar over the past 2-3 months. Reflects how much glucose has "stuck" to red blood cells. 

**Key insight: **More stable than fasting glucose (not affected by yesterday's pizza). An A1c of 5.5% is "normal" but associated with increased cardiovascular risk compared to 5.0%. Prediabetes starts at 5.7%. 
### Lipid Panel 
#### The Old vs New Understanding 

The old model: "High cholesterol = heart disease." The new understanding: Lipids are more nuanced. Total cholesterol alone is nearly meaningless. What matters is the size and number of LDL particles, triglyceride/HDL ratio, and inflammatory markers. Context matters. 
#### Triglycerides 

Lab "Normal" Range 

<150 mg/dL 

Optimal Range 

<100 mg/dL (ideally <70) 

**What it measures: **Fat in your blood, largely driven by carbohydrate intake and insulin resistance. 

**Key insight: **Triglycerides are more responsive to diet than LDL. High triglycerides + low HDL = metabolic syndrome pattern. Often improves dramatically with carbohydrate reduction. 
#### HDL Cholesterol 

Lab "Normal" Range 

>40 mg/dL (men), >50 (women) 

Optimal Range 

>50 mg/dL (men), >60 (women) 

**What it measures: **"Good" cholesterol that helps transport cholesterol away from arteries. 

**Key insight: **HDL is protective. Low HDL is often a sign of metabolic dysfunction. Exercise, moderate alcohol, and healthy fats raise HDL. The triglyceride/HDL ratio is a useful proxy for insulin resistance (optimal <2.0). 
#### LDL Cholesterol 

Lab "Normal" Range 

<100 mg/dL 

Optimal Range 

Context-dependent 

**What it measures: **Usually calculated, not measured directly. Represents the cholesterol carried by LDL particles. 

**Key insight: **LDL-C (cholesterol content) is less predictive than LDL-P (particle number) or ApoB. You can have low LDL-C but high particle number (more atherogenic) or vice versa. Advanced lipid testing provides more actionable data. 
### Inflammation & Other Markers 
#### hsCRP (High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein) 

Lab "Normal" Range 

<3.0 mg/L 

Optimal Range 

<1.0 mg/L 

**What it measures: **A marker of systemic inflammation. Produced by the liver in response to inflammation anywhere in the body. 

**Key insight: **Elevated hsCRP is associated with increased cardiovascular risk independent of cholesterol. Can be elevated by acute infection, chronic disease, obesity, or metabolic dysfunction. Useful for tracking inflammation over time. 
#### Vitamin D (25-OH) 

Lab "Normal" Range 

30–100 ng/mL 

Optimal Range 

50–70 ng/mL 

**What it measures: **Your vitamin D status. Actually a hormone precursor, not just a vitamin. 

**Key insight: **Deficiency is extremely common, especially in northern latitudes. Low vitamin D is linked to immune dysfunction, mood issues, fatigue, and increased disease risk. Most people need supplementation to reach optimal levels. 
#### Ferritin 

Lab "Normal" Range 

12–300 ng/mL (men) 

Optimal Range 

50–150 ng/mL 

**What it measures: **Iron stores. Low ferritin = depleted iron. Very high ferritin can indicate iron overload or inflammation. 

**Key insight: **Low ferritin causes fatigue even with "normal" hemoglobin. Common in menstruating women and endurance athletes. Very high ferritin (>400) warrants further investigation for hemochromatosis or chronic inflammation. 
### Common Patterns to Watch For 
#### Metabolic Syndrome Pattern 

High triglycerides (>150), low HDL (<40 men/<50 women), elevated fasting glucose (>100), high insulin (>10). Often with elevated hsCRP. This pattern precedes type 2 diabetes by years. 
#### Subclinical Hypothyroid Pattern 

TSH 2.5–4.5 (technically "normal"), low-normal Free T3, fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, brain fog. Often dismissed as "normal" despite clear symptoms. 
#### High SHBG Pattern (Men) 

Total testosterone looks fine (500-700), but free testosterone is low (<10 pg/mL) due to elevated SHBG. Symptoms of low T despite "normal" total T. Often caused by aging, low-carb diets, or elevated estrogen. 
#### Inflammation + Poor Metabolic Health 

Elevated hsCRP (>2), high triglycerides, high insulin, elevated LDL-P. This combination significantly increases cardiovascular risk even if LDL-C looks okay. 
### What To Do With This Information 

Understanding your labs is the first step. The next step is working with a provider who interprets them in context—looking at patterns, symptoms, and your goals rather than just checking boxes. 

At Moonshot, we run comprehensive panels and take the time to explain what each marker means for YOU. We aim for optimal, not just "normal."

### Low Testosterone Symptoms in Men

Men's Health 
## LOW TESTOSTERONE SYMPTOMS 

Tired all the time? Lost your drive? These symptoms get blamed on "getting older"—but they could be signs of low testosterone. Here's what to look for. 
### The 8 Most Common Low Testosterone Symptoms 

- 1. Persistent fatigue despite adequate sleep 
- 2. Low sex drive (decreased libido) 
- 3. Erectile dysfunction 
- 4. Brain fog and difficulty concentrating 

- 5. Loss of muscle mass and strength 
- 6. Increased body fat (especially belly fat) 
- 7. Mood changes (irritability, depression) 
- 8. Poor sleep quality 
### SYMPTOMS EXPLAINED 

Low testosterone affects nearly every system in your body. Here's what each symptom looks like and why it happens. 
#### Fatigue & Low Energy 

Not just "tired"—this is a persistent exhaustion that doesn't improve with sleep. You wake up tired, drag through the day, and lack the energy for activities you used to enjoy. 

**Why it happens: **Testosterone affects mitochondrial function and red blood cell production. Low T means less cellular energy and potentially mild anemia. 
#### Decreased Sex Drive 

Noticeable decline in sexual interest. You're not thinking about sex, don't pursue it, and may feel indifferent even when the opportunity arises. 

**Why it happens: **Testosterone is the primary driver of male libido. When levels drop, so does desire—it's physiological, not psychological. 
#### Erectile Dysfunction 

Difficulty getting or maintaining erections. May include fewer morning erections, softer erections, or complete inability to achieve erection. 

**Why it happens: **Testosterone stimulates nitric oxide production needed for erections. Low T also reduces neural sensitivity. Note: ED has many causes—low T is just one. 
#### Brain Fog & Poor Focus 

Difficulty concentrating, poor memory, "fuzzy" thinking. Harder to stay focused at work. Forgetting things you normally wouldn't forget. 

**Why it happens: **Testosterone affects cognitive function, including memory and executive function. The brain has testosterone receptors throughout. 
#### Loss of Muscle Mass 

Getting weaker despite working out. Muscles feel smaller or softer. Harder to build or maintain muscle than it used to be. 

**Why it happens: **Testosterone is anabolic—it builds muscle. Low T shifts your body toward catabolism (breaking down tissue). 
#### Increased Body Fat 

Weight gain, especially around the abdomen. The "dad bod" progression despite similar diet and exercise. Difficulty losing fat. 

**Why it happens: **Low testosterone increases fat storage and reduces fat burning. Fat cells also convert testosterone to estrogen, creating a negative cycle. 
#### Mood Changes 

Irritability, depression, anxiety, lack of motivation. Feeling "flat" emotionally. Less drive and ambition than you used to have. 

**Why it happens: **Testosterone affects neurotransmitters including dopamine (motivation, pleasure) and serotonin (mood stability). 
#### Poor Sleep Quality 

Insomnia, restless sleep, waking frequently, or sleep that doesn't feel restorative. Irony: poor sleep also lowers testosterone. 

**Why it happens: **Testosterone and sleep have a bidirectional relationship. Low T disrupts sleep architecture; poor sleep further lowers T. 
### OTHER SIGNS OF LOW TESTOSTERONE 
#### Hot Flashes 

Yes, men get them too when T drops suddenly 
#### Gynecomastia 

Breast tissue development from estrogen imbalance 
#### Hair Loss 

Reduced body/facial hair (scalp hair is different) 
#### Bone Loss 

Testosterone supports bone density in men 
#### Decreased Testicle Size 

Testicles may shrink with prolonged low T 
#### Reduced Competitiveness 

Less drive to compete, win, or achieve 
### WHAT CAUSES LOW TESTOSTERONE? 

Low T can stem from problems with the testicles themselves (primary) or signals from the brain (secondary). Often, lifestyle factors accelerate what would otherwise be gradual age-related decline. 
#### Primary Causes (Testicular) 

- Age-related decline (starting around 30) 
- Testicular injury or infection 
- Cancer treatment (chemo, radiation) 
- Genetic conditions (Klinefelter syndrome) 
- Undescended testicles 
#### Secondary Causes (Brain/Pituitary) 

- Chronic stress (elevated cortisol) 
- Obesity (fat converts T to estrogen) 
- Poor sleep / sleep apnea 
- Pituitary disorders 
- Medications (opioids, steroids) 
#### The Age Factor 

Testosterone levels naturally decline about 1% per year after age 30. By 45, you may have 20-30% less testosterone than your peak. By 60, some men have lost 50% or more. But age-related decline alone doesn't explain severe symptoms—other factors usually contribute. 
### WHEN TO GET TESTED 
#### Consider Testing If: 

- You have 3+ symptoms from the list above 
- Symptoms persist despite adequate sleep and stress management 
- You're over 35 (earlier if symptomatic) 
- You're overweight or have metabolic issues 
- You take medications known to lower T (opioids, certain antidepressants) 
- Symptoms significantly impact your quality of life 
#### What Gets Tested 

A proper testosterone evaluation includes more than just total testosterone: 

- **Total Testosterone **- Overall level 
- **Free Testosterone **- What's actually available 
- **SHBG **- Protein that binds testosterone 
- **LH & FSH **- Signals from brain to testes 

- **Estradiol **- Important for balance 
- **Prolactin **- Can suppress testosterone 
- **Thyroid Panel **- Symptoms overlap 
- **CBC & Metabolic Panel **- Overall health 
#### What's a "Normal" Level? 

Most labs define low testosterone as below 300 ng/dL. But here's the problem: "normal" ranges include unhealthy men and very old men. A 35-year-old with 310 ng/dL is "normal" but probably not optimal. 

**Lab "Normal": **300-1000 ng/dL 

**Optimal for Most Men: **500-900 ng/dL 

Free testosterone matters too. Total can be "normal" while free T is low. 
### TREATMENT OPTIONS 
#### Lifestyle Optimization (First Line) 

For mild cases, lifestyle changes can meaningfully improve testosterone: 
##### Strength Training 

Compound lifts (squats, deadlifts) boost T acutely and chronically 
##### Sleep Optimization 

7-8 hours of quality sleep. Most T is produced during sleep. 
##### Body Fat Reduction 

Fat cells convert testosterone to estrogen. Losing fat raises T. 
##### Stress Management 

Chronic stress = chronic cortisol = lower testosterone 
#### Medical Treatment 

When lifestyle changes aren't enough, or levels are significantly low, medical treatment may be appropriate: 
##### Testosterone Replacement (TRT) 

Injectable, topical, or pellet testosterone to restore optimal levels. Most effective option for symptomatic low T. Learn how TRT differs from anabolic steroids . 
##### Enclomiphene / Clomid 

Stimulates your body to produce more testosterone naturally. Option for younger men concerned about fertility. Read: TRT vs Enclomiphene - Which Is Right for You? → 
### COMMON QUESTIONS 
#### How do I know if it's low T or just aging? 

Gradual, mild changes are normal aging. But severe fatigue, complete loss of libido, significant muscle wasting, and mood issues that affect daily life aren't inevitable—they're often treatable hormone imbalance. The only way to know is to test. 
#### Can low testosterone cause depression? 

Yes. Testosterone affects neurotransmitters involved in mood regulation. Many men diagnosed with depression actually have untreated low T. If antidepressants haven't fully helped, checking testosterone is worth considering. 
#### I'm in my 30s—can I have low T? 

Yes. While average testosterone declines with age, young men can have low T too. Poor sleep, chronic stress, obesity, certain medications, and underlying conditions can all cause low testosterone at any age. 
#### Is testosterone therapy safe? 

When properly monitored, testosterone therapy has a good safety profile. Regular monitoring of blood counts, PSA, and other markers helps catch and prevent potential issues. The risks of untreated low T (metabolic issues, bone loss, cardiovascular risk) are often greater than treatment risks. 
#### Will treatment affect my fertility? 

Standard TRT can suppress sperm production. If fertility is a concern, options like HCG or enclomiphene can help maintain fertility while addressing low T symptoms. This should be discussed before starting any treatment.

### TRT vs Steroids: What's the Difference?
URL: https://moonshotmp.com/learn/trt-vs-steroids/

← Back to Learn 

Men's Health 
## TRT VS STEROIDS 

"Isn't TRT just steroids?" It's one of the most common questions we hear. The short answer is no—and the distinction matters for your health. Here's what you need to know. 
### THE MISCONCEPTION 

When people hear "testosterone therapy," many immediately think of bodybuilders, 'roid rage, and health disasters. This conflation of TRT with anabolic steroid abuse is understandable—both involve testosterone—but it's like comparing a glass of wine with dinner to binge drinking vodka. Same substance category, entirely different risk profile. 
#### The Key Differences at a Glance 
##### TRT (Testosterone Replacement) 

- Bioidentical testosterone 
- Physiological doses (100-200mg/week) 
- Target: 500-900 ng/dL 
- Medical supervision & monitoring 
- Treats diagnosed deficiency 
- Long-term safety data available 
##### Anabolic Steroid Abuse 

- Often synthetic derivatives 
- Supraphysiological doses (500-2000mg+/week) 
- Target: 3,000-5,000+ ng/dL 
- Usually unsupervised 
- Performance/physique enhancement 
- Known cardiovascular damage 
### BIOIDENTICAL VS. SYNTHETIC STEROIDS 

TRT uses **bioidentical testosterone **—testosterone cypionate or enanthate—which is molecularly identical to the testosterone your body produces naturally. Your body recognizes it, metabolizes it normally, and responds to it the same way it responds to endogenous testosterone. 

**Anabolic steroids **, on the other hand, are synthetic derivatives. Chemists have modified the testosterone molecule to: 
#### Common Modifications 

- **17-alpha alkylation: **Makes the steroid orally active but dramatically increases liver toxicity (e.g., Dianabol, Anadrol) 
- **19-nortestosterone derivatives: **Removes a carbon to increase anabolic:androgenic ratio (e.g., Nandrolone/Deca, Trenbolone) 
- **DHT derivatives: **Modified for specific tissue effects (e.g., Stanozolol/Winstrol, Anavar) 
#### Why Modifications Matter 

- Changed metabolism = different side effect profiles 
- Many don't aromatize to estrogen = worse lipid profiles 
- Some are directly cardiotoxic 
- Liver stress from oral compounds 
- Harder for the body to process and eliminate 

The distinction matters: your body evolved to handle testosterone. It did not evolve to handle Trenbolone. 
### DOSE IS EVERYTHING 

Even with bioidentical testosterone, dose determines safety. The difference between replacement and abuse is roughly 5-10x. 
#### Typical Dosing Comparison TRT 100-200 mg/week "Beginner" Cycle 500 mg/week Advanced Cycle 1000-2000+ mg/week 

Note: "Advanced" cycles often stack multiple compounds, not just testosterone 
#### TRT Blood Levels 

Target: **500-900 ng/dL **

This is the normal healthy range for adult men. Most men on TRT aim for the upper end of normal. 
#### Steroid Cycle Blood Levels 

Typical: **3,000-5,000+ ng/dL **

5-10x normal levels. Some competitors push even higher. This is where serious damage occurs. 
### WHY STEROIDS DAMAGE THE HEART 

The cardiovascular risks of anabolic steroids are well-documented, and they're dose-dependent. Here's how supraphysiological doses—and certain synthetic compounds—damage the cardiovascular system: 
#### Left Ventricular Hypertrophy 

High-dose androgens cause the heart muscle to thicken, particularly the left ventricle. This "athlete's heart" isn't the same as exercise-induced adaptation—it's pathological remodeling that reduces cardiac function and increases risk of arrhythmias and sudden death. 
#### Dyslipidemia 

Anabolic steroids devastate lipid profiles . HDL ("good cholesterol") can drop 50% or more. LDL rises. ApoB increases. This accelerates atherosclerosis—plaque buildup in arteries. Many synthetic steroids that don't aromatize (convert to estrogen) are particularly bad for lipids. 
#### Elevated Hematocrit 

Testosterone stimulates red blood cell production. At supraphysiological doses, hematocrit (blood thickness) can rise dangerously high, increasing risk of stroke, pulmonary embolism, and heart attack. TRT requires monitoring; steroid abuse often ignores this. 
#### Direct Cardiotoxicity 

Some synthetic steroids (particularly trenbolone and nandrolone) appear to be directly toxic to heart tissue, independent of dose. They cause fibrosis, impair contractility, and damage the heart in ways bioidentical testosterone does not. 
#### Estrogen Imbalance 

Estrogen is cardioprotective in men (at appropriate levels). Many synthetic steroids don't aromatize to estrogen, creating an unfavorable androgen:estrogen ratio. Others require aggressive estrogen blockers that further compromise cardiovascular protection. 
#### Blood Pressure 

High-dose androgens raise blood pressure through multiple mechanisms: fluid retention, vascular remodeling, and sympathetic activation. Chronic hypertension compounds all other cardiovascular risks. 
#### The Research Is Clear 

Studies of long-term steroid users show significantly higher rates of cardiovascular events, reduced ejection fraction, and premature death compared to non-users. A 2017 study in *Circulation *found that anabolic steroid users had significantly impaired coronary artery plaque volume—even years after stopping use.¹ 
### TRT'S SAFETY PROFILE 

When properly prescribed and monitored, TRT at physiological doses has a favorable safety profile. The goal is to restore what's deficient, not to exceed normal human physiology. 
#### What Proper TRT Looks Like 

- ✓ **Diagnosis first: **Confirmed low testosterone via blood tests, not just symptoms 
- ✓ **Bioidentical testosterone: **Testosterone cypionate or enanthate—the same molecule your body makes 
- ✓ **Physiological dosing: **Enough to reach normal levels, not supraphysiological 
- ✓ **Regular monitoring: **Hematocrit, lipids, PSA, estradiol checked every 3-6 months 
- ✓ **Dose adjustments: **Titrated based on labs and symptoms, not arbitrary 
- ✓ **Medical supervision: **A provider who can catch and address issues early 

Large-scale studies have found that men on properly-monitored TRT don't have increased cardiovascular risk compared to untreated men—and may actually have improved outcomes compared to men with untreated low testosterone .² ³ 

The key variables are: **dose **, **compound **, and **monitoring **. TRT gets all three right. Steroid abuse gets all three wrong. 
### COMMON QUESTIONS 
#### "But testosterone IS a steroid, right?" 

Technically, yes—testosterone is a steroid hormone. So are estrogen, cortisol, and vitamin D. The word "steroid" just describes the molecular structure. But in common usage, "steroids" refers to supraphysiological use for performance enhancement. Calling TRT "steroids" is like calling your morning coffee "drug abuse" because caffeine is a stimulant. 
#### "Will TRT make me 'roid rage'?" 

At physiological doses? No. The aggression associated with steroid abuse comes from supraphysiological doses—particularly certain synthetic compounds like trenbolone. Many men on TRT actually report improved mood stability because they're no longer deficient. 'Roid rage is a supraphysiological dose phenomenon. 
#### "Is TRT cheating in sports?" 

Most sports organizations ban TRT (with some therapeutic use exemptions). But this is about fairness in competition, not health. Having testosterone levels of 700 ng/dL—normal for a healthy man—isn't the same as having levels of 4,000 ng/dL. The rules exist because it's impossible to verify someone is staying at physiological levels. 
#### "My doctor said testosterone causes heart attacks." 

This concern comes from a flawed 2014 study that has been widely criticized and contradicted by subsequent research. Multiple large-scale studies have since shown that properly-monitored TRT does not increase cardiovascular risk—and that untreated low testosterone is itself a cardiovascular risk factor. The Endocrine Society and AUA guidelines support TRT for appropriate candidates.⁴ ⁵ 
#### "Can former steroid users safely do TRT?" 

Often, yes—and they may need it. Long-term steroid use can permanently suppress natural testosterone production. These men genuinely become hypogonadal. TRT at physiological doses is far safer than continued steroid abuse, though prior damage (especially cardiac) needs to be evaluated first. 
### THE BOTTOM LINE 

TRT and anabolic steroid abuse exist on entirely different risk spectrums: 
#### TRT Done Right 

- Restores deficient hormone to normal 
- Uses what your body naturally makes 
- Regular monitoring catches issues early 
- Supported by medical evidence 
- Improves quality of life safely 
#### Steroid Abuse 

- Exceeds normal physiology by 5-10x+ 
- Often uses synthetic derivatives 
- Usually unsupervised 
- Known cardiovascular damage 
- Trades long-term health for short-term gains 

If you're considering TRT, work with a provider who understands the difference—who will test your levels, prescribe appropriate doses, and monitor your health. That's not "doing steroids." That's treating a medical condition with appropriate medical care.

### Optimal vs Normal Lab Ranges: Why "Normal" Isn't Good Enough
URL: https://moonshotmp.com/learn/optimal-vs-normal/

← Back to Learn 

Diagnostics & Testing 
## OPTIMAL VS NORMAL 

Your labs came back "normal." But you still feel tired, foggy, and off. Here's why "normal" doesn't mean what you think it means—and what to look for instead. 
### THE PROBLEM WITH "NORMAL" 

You go to the doctor because you're exhausted, gaining weight, losing motivation, and can't think clearly. They run bloodwork . A few days later: "Everything looks normal." End of conversation. 

This happens constantly. And the reason is simple: your doctor is using reference ranges designed to detect disease, not optimize health. 
### HOW LAB REFERENCE RANGES ARE BUILT 

When you see a "normal range" on a lab report, here's how it was determined: 
#### Step 1: Test a Large Group of People 

Labs collect results from a large reference population. This population includes healthy people, sick people, people on medications, sedentary people, elderly people—essentially everyone who got that test done. 
#### Step 2: Take the Middle 95% 

The reference range is defined as the middle 95% of results (2 standard deviations from the mean). The top 2.5% and bottom 2.5% are cut off and flagged as "abnormal." 
#### Step 3: Call It "Normal" 

If your result falls within that range, it's reported as normal. If it falls outside, it gets flagged. Your doctor reviews flagged values. Unflagged values are usually not discussed. 

**Here's the problem: **"Normal" just means "statistically common in the tested population." It doesn't mean healthy. It doesn't mean optimal. And because the reference population includes unhealthy people, the range is wider than it should be. A 45-year-old man with a testosterone of 310 ng/dL is "normal" by lab standards—but that same level is associated with fatigue, low libido, brain fog, and metabolic decline. 
### THE GAP BETWEEN "NOT SICK" AND "ACTUALLY WELL" 

Conventional medicine is built around a binary: sick or not sick. If your labs don't indicate disease, you're "fine." But there's a massive spectrum between disease and optimal health—and that's where most people live. 

Disease 

Below Range 

Flagged on labs 

Suboptimal 

"Normal" But Symptomatic 

Not flagged. Still a problem. 

Optimal 

Best Health Outcomes 

Where you want to be 

Excess 

Above Range 

Flagged on labs 

The yellow zone is where most frustrated patients live. Their labs aren't alarming enough to trigger treatment, but they're far enough from optimal to cause real symptoms. Performance medicine focuses on that gap. 
### WHERE IT MATTERS MOST 

Here are the biomarkers where the gap between "normal" and "optimal" has the biggest practical impact on how you feel. 
#### Testosterone (Men) 

Lab "Normal" 

300–1000 ng/dL 

Optimal 

500–900 ng/dL 

Symptomatic Zone 

300–500 ng/dL 

A 40-year-old man with a total testosterone of 350 ng/dL is technically "normal." He's also likely experiencing fatigue, low libido, brain fog, and difficulty maintaining muscle. The lab won't flag it. His doctor won't treat it. But at 600+ ng/dL, those symptoms often resolve. Free testosterone matters too—total can look normal while free T is low. 
#### TSH (Thyroid) 

Lab "Normal" 

0.5–4.5 mIU/L 

Optimal 

1.0–2.0 mIU/L 

Symptomatic Zone 

2.5–4.5 mIU/L 

TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) is the standard thyroid screening test—and one of the most frustrating. A TSH of 4.0 is "normal" but can cause fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, hair loss, and depression. Many endocrinologists now agree that TSH above 2.5 warrants investigation, especially if symptoms are present. And TSH alone doesn't tell the full story—Free T3 and Free T4 matter too. 
#### Vitamin D (25-OH) 

Lab "Normal" 

30–100 ng/mL 

Optimal 

50–70 ng/mL 

Symptomatic Zone 

30–50 ng/mL 

A vitamin D of 32 ng/mL is "normal" but associated with suboptimal immune function, mood issues, and poor bone health. Most people in northern climates (like Chicago) are in this range or below. Research consistently shows better outcomes at 50-70 ng/mL for immune function, mood, bone density, and overall health. 
#### Fasting Insulin 

Lab "Normal" 

2.0–25.0 uIU/mL 

Optimal 

2.0–8.0 uIU/mL 

Early Warning Zone 

10–25 uIU/mL 

This one is critical—and most doctors don't even order it. Fasting insulin above 10 suggests your body is working overtime to manage blood sugar, even if your glucose looks fine. By the time glucose goes abnormal, insulin resistance has been building for years. Fasting insulin is an early warning system for metabolic disease. A level of 20 is "normal" but screaming that something is wrong. 
#### Ferritin (Iron Stores) 

Lab "Normal" 

12–300 ng/mL 

Optimal 

50–150 ng/mL 

Symptomatic Zone 

12–50 ng/mL 

The normal range for ferritin is absurdly wide: 12-300 ng/mL. A woman with a ferritin of 15 is "normal" but almost certainly experiencing fatigue, hair loss, poor exercise tolerance, and brain fog. Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency worldwide, and it's routinely missed because the reference range starts too low. This is especially common in menstruating women and active people. 
#### Hemoglobin A1c 

Lab "Normal" 

Below 5.7% 

Optimal 

Below 5.3% 

Watch Zone 

5.4–5.6% 

A1c measures your average blood sugar over ~3 months. Below 5.7% is "normal," 5.7-6.4% is "prediabetes," and above 6.5% is diabetes. But an A1c of 5.6% isn't cause for celebration—it's a warning sign that metabolic health is trending the wrong direction. By the time you hit 5.7%, damage has already been accumulating. Optimal is below 5.3%. 
#### hs-CRP (Inflammation) 

Lab "Normal" 

Below 3.0 mg/L 

Optimal 

Below 1.0 mg/L 

Elevated Risk Zone 

1.0–3.0 mg/L 

High-sensitivity C-reactive protein measures systemic inflammation. Levels between 1-3 mg/L represent moderate cardiovascular risk , but they're "normal." Chronic low-grade inflammation drives aging, metabolic disease, and cardiovascular events. Optimal is below 1.0 mg/L—which is achievable through diet, exercise, sleep, and addressing underlying causes. 
### WHY THIS MATTERS 

This isn't about being neurotic or chasing perfect numbers. It's about understanding that your labs are a map—and the conventional approach reads the map at too low a resolution. 
#### It Explains Symptoms 

If you've been told "your labs are fine" but still feel terrible, the answer is often hiding in the gap between normal and optimal. Suboptimal thyroid , borderline testosterone, low-normal iron, or creeping insulin resistance can each cause real symptoms. Together, they compound. 
#### It Catches Problems Early 

A fasting insulin of 18 won't trigger a diagnosis. But it tells you that metabolic dysfunction is building. A vitamin D of 25 won't flag as deficient at most labs. But it tells you that immune function, mood, and bone health are compromised. Optimal ranges function as an early warning system. 
#### It Drives Better Decisions 

When you see the full picture at higher resolution, treatment decisions become clearer. Instead of "your testosterone is normal," you see "your testosterone is in the bottom 15th percentile for your age, your free T is low, and your SHBG is high—here's why you feel like this and here's what we can do." 
#### It Creates Accountability 

When you track biomarkers over time against optimal targets, you can measure whether interventions (lifestyle changes, supplements, medications) are actually working. Numbers don't lie, and trends tell a story that single snapshots miss. 
### HOW WE USE THIS AT MOONSHOT 

Our entire model is built on this distinction. Every patient gets a comprehensive panel that goes far beyond standard lab work—and every result is interpreted through an optimal lens, not just a reference range. 
#### We Test More 

Standard physicals might check a CBC, metabolic panel, and maybe a lipid panel. We add hormones (total and free testosterone, estradiol, DHEA-S, progesterone), thyroid (full panel, not just TSH), metabolic markers (fasting insulin, A1c, HOMA-IR), inflammation (hs-CRP), vitamins (D, B12), and iron studies. 
#### We Interpret Differently 

We review every marker against optimal targets, not just reference ranges. We look at patterns across markers—for example, a TSH of 3.5 with fatigue and low-normal Free T3 tells a different story than a TSH of 3.5 with no symptoms and strong Free T3. 
#### We Track Over Time 

A single lab draw is a snapshot. We track trends over time—how markers respond to treatment, how they shift with lifestyle changes, and whether you're moving toward or away from optimal. This is how you actually manage health, not just check boxes. 
### WHAT YOU CAN DO RIGHT NOW 

Even if you don't come to Moonshot, here are steps you can take with your current provider: 
#### 1. Get Your Actual Numbers 

Don't accept "everything's normal." Ask for a copy of your results—you're entitled to them. Look at the actual values, not just the in-range/out-of-range flags. 
#### 2. Ask for a Full Panel 

Request: total and free testosterone (yes, even women), full thyroid panel (TSH + Free T3 + Free T4), fasting insulin (not just glucose), vitamin D, ferritin, and hs-CRP. Most doctors will order these if you ask. 
#### 3. Compare to Optimal Ranges 

Use the ranges in this article as a starting point. If your values are "normal" but fall in the symptomatic zones described above, that's worth a conversation with a provider who takes optimization seriously. 
#### 4. Track Your Trends 

Get labs done at regular intervals (every 3-6 months if actively optimizing, annually at minimum). Compare your results over time. A testosterone dropping from 550 to 380 over two years is a meaningful trend—even though both are "normal." 
### COMMON QUESTIONS 
#### Is this just "functional medicine" / alternative medicine? 

No. Optimal ranges aren't fringe—they're based on the same peer-reviewed research that informs conventional medicine. The difference is in how the data is applied. We use the same evidence base; we just set the bar at "where health outcomes are best," not "where disease is absent." Many endocrinologists, cardiologists, and sports medicine doctors use these tighter ranges in their practice. 
#### Will my insurance cover the additional tests? 

It depends on the test and your insurance. Basic hormones, thyroid panels, and metabolic markers are typically covered, especially with appropriate diagnostic codes. Some specialized markers may not be. At Moonshot, our comprehensive panel is included in your membership—no insurance hassle. 
#### How often should I get labs done? 

If you're starting a new treatment (hormone therapy, weight loss, etc.): every 6-8 weeks initially, then every 3-6 months once stable. For general health monitoring: every 6-12 months. If something was flagged as suboptimal and you made changes: recheck in 8-12 weeks to see if it moved. 
#### Can I over-optimize? Is there such a thing as too many labs? 

Yes, there's a point of diminishing returns. The goal is informed decision-making, not obsessive tracking. A comprehensive panel 2-4 times per year gives you the data you need. What matters is acting on the data—not just collecting it.

### Testosterone for Women

Women's Health 
## TESTOSTERONE FOR WOMEN 

It's not just a "male hormone." Testosterone plays a critical role in women's energy, mood, libido, and body composition—and it's often the missing piece. 
### THE BASICS 

Women produce testosterone. Not as much as men—roughly 1/10th to 1/20th the amount—but it's not a trace hormone. In fact, women produce more testosterone than estrogen throughout most of their lives. 

Testosterone is made in the ovaries and adrenal glands. After menopause , the ovaries continue to produce some testosterone even after estrogen production drops dramatically. 

Here's the problem: testosterone levels decline gradually starting in the 20s. By the time a woman reaches her 40s, she may have half the testosterone she had at 20. This decline continues through menopause and beyond. 

**Key point: **Many symptoms attributed to estrogen deficiency in menopause—fatigue, low libido, brain fog, muscle loss—are actually related to testosterone deficiency. But testosterone is rarely tested or addressed. 
### WHAT TESTOSTERONE DOES IN WOMEN 
#### Energy & Vitality 

Testosterone affects mitochondrial function—the energy factories in your cells. Low T often manifests as persistent fatigue that sleep doesn't fix. 
#### Libido & Sexual Function 

Testosterone is the primary driver of sexual desire in women. Low libido in menopause is often testosterone-related, not estrogen-related. 
#### Mood & Motivation 

Testosterone affects dopamine and other neurotransmitters. Low T can cause depression, anxiety, loss of motivation, and decreased sense of wellbeing. 
#### Muscle & Strength 

Testosterone is anabolic—it helps build and maintain muscle. Without adequate T, maintaining muscle mass becomes increasingly difficult. 
#### Body Composition 

Low testosterone promotes fat storage, especially abdominal fat. The "middle-age spread" isn't inevitable—it's often hormonal. 
#### Cognitive Function 

Testosterone supports memory, concentration, and mental clarity. "Brain fog" during perimenopause often involves testosterone decline. 
### SYMPTOMS OF LOW TESTOSTERONE IN WOMEN 
#### Primary Symptoms 

- **Persistent fatigue **that doesn't improve with sleep 
- **Low or absent libido **—no interest in sex 
- **Difficulty building muscle **despite exercise 
- **Unexplained weight gain **especially abdominal 
- **Brain fog **and difficulty concentrating 
#### Other Signs 

- **Depressed mood **or loss of motivation 
- **Anxiety **that's new or worsening 
- **Decreased sense of wellbeing **—"not feeling like yourself" 
- **Thinning hair **on scalp 
- **Bone loss **(testosterone supports bone density) 

**Note: **These symptoms overlap with other conditions including thyroid dysfunction , depression, and estrogen deficiency. That's why comprehensive testing matters—you need to see the full picture. 
### WHY TESTOSTERONE IS OVERLOOKED IN WOMEN 
#### No FDA-Approved Product for Women 

In the US, there's no testosterone product approved specifically for women. This makes many doctors hesitant to prescribe it, even though off-label use is common and products exist in other countries (Australia, UK, Europe). 
#### Lack of Research Funding 

Without an approvable drug, pharmaceutical companies haven't funded large trials. The research that does exist is largely positive, but it's smaller in scale than estrogen research. 
#### Cultural Misconceptions 

"Testosterone is for men" is deeply ingrained. Many women (and doctors) worry about masculinizing effects that don't occur at physiological female doses. 
#### Testing Isn't Standard 

Most doctors don't include testosterone in women's hormone panels. If you don't look for it, you won't find it. 
### TESTOSTERONE THERAPY FOR WOMEN 

Testosterone therapy for women is very different from men. The goal is to restore levels to the normal female range—not to achieve male levels. 
#### Normal Testosterone Ranges 

**Women (premenopausal): **

Total: 15-70 ng/dL 

Free: 0.5-2.0 pg/mL 

**For comparison, men: **

Total: 300-1000 ng/dL 

Free: 5-21 pg/mL 

Women's doses are ~1/10th of men's doses. 
#### Delivery Methods 

- **Compounded cream/gel: **Applied daily to skin. Most common approach. Easy to adjust dosing. 
- **Pellets: **Implanted under the skin every 3-4 months. Steady release, no daily application. 
- **Injections: **Less common in women but sometimes used. Weekly or biweekly. 
#### What About Side Effects? 

At physiological doses, side effects are uncommon. Possible effects include: 

- Acne (dose-dependent, usually resolves with adjustment) 
- Mild hair growth (usually fine, light hair—not masculine) 
- Oily skin 

**Masculinizing effects **(deepened voice, significant facial hair, clitoral enlargement) occur at supraphysiological doses—far higher than what's prescribed for women's health. Proper dosing and monitoring prevents these issues. 
### THE EVIDENCE 

Research supports testosterone therapy for women, particularly for: 

- **Sexual function: **Multiple studies show improved desire, arousal, and satisfaction¹ 
- **Mood and wellbeing: **Improvements in depression, anxiety, and quality of life² 
- **Body composition: **Increased lean mass, decreased fat mass³ 
- **Bone density: **Additive benefit when combined with estrogen⁴ 

In 2019, the Global Consensus Position Statement on testosterone therapy for women (endorsed by multiple international medical societies) concluded that testosterone therapy can be considered for postmenopausal women with low sexual desire causing distress.⁵

### Menopause & Perimenopause Guide
URL: https://moonshotmp.com/learn/menopause-perimenopause/

← Back to Learn 

Women's Health 
## MENOPAUSE & PERIMENOPAUSE 

A complete guide to understanding the transition—what's happening in your body, what to expect, and what you can do about it. 
### WHAT IS MENOPAUSE? 

Menopause isn't a disease—it's a natural biological transition. But "natural" doesn't mean you have to suffer through it without support. 

**Menopause **is officially diagnosed after 12 consecutive months without a menstrual period. The average age is 51, but it can occur anywhere from 45-55 for most women. 

**Perimenopause **is the transition phase leading up to menopause. This is when most symptoms occur, and it can last 4-10 years. Hormone levels become unpredictable—rising and falling erratically before eventually declining. 

**Postmenopause **is everything after menopause. Hormone levels stabilize at lower levels, and many symptoms improve, but new considerations emerge (bone health, cardiovascular risk , cognitive changes). 
### THE THREE STAGES 

Stage 1 
#### Perimenopause 

Typically begins mid-40s (can start late 30s). Periods become irregular. Hormones fluctuate unpredictably. 

**Duration: **4-10 years 

**Key changes: **Progesterone drops first, estrogen fluctuates wildly, testosterone gradually declines 

Stage 2 
#### Menopause 

Defined as 12 months without a period. Average age 51. A single point in time, not a phase. 

**Duration: **One moment 

**Key changes: **Ovaries stop releasing eggs, estrogen production drops significantly 

Stage 3 
#### Postmenopause 

Everything after menopause. Hormone levels stabilize at lower levels. New health considerations emerge. 

**Duration: **Rest of life 

**Key changes: **Increased cardiovascular risk, bone density loss accelerates, metabolic changes 
### COMMON SYMPTOMS 

Symptoms vary widely. Some women sail through with minimal issues. Others experience significant disruption. Both are normal. 
#### Vasomotor (Hot Flashes) 

Hot flashes, night sweats, flushing. Affects 75-80% of women. Can last 7+ years for some. 
#### Sleep Disruption 

Difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking unrefreshed . Often linked to night sweats. 
#### Mood Changes 

Irritability, anxiety, depression, brain fog. Estrogen affects neurotransmitters including serotonin. 
#### Body Composition 

Weight gain (especially abdominal), muscle loss, difficulty maintaining previous fitness levels. 
#### Genitourinary 

Vaginal dryness, painful intercourse, urinary symptoms. Affects up to 50% of postmenopausal women. 
#### Other 

Joint pain, headaches, heart palpitations, skin changes, hair thinning, low libido. 
### WHAT'S HAPPENING HORMONALLY 
#### Estrogen (Estradiol) 

The primary female sex hormone. During perimenopause, estrogen doesn't just decline—it fluctuates wildly, sometimes spiking higher than normal before eventually dropping. This instability causes many perimenopausal symptoms. After menopause, estrogen stabilizes at about 10-20% of premenopausal levels. 
#### Progesterone 

Often the first to decline, even before perimenopause symptoms begin. Progesterone is produced after ovulation—as ovulation becomes irregular, progesterone drops. Low progesterone relative to estrogen (" estrogen dominance ") can cause heavy periods, breast tenderness, and mood changes early in the transition. 
#### Testosterone 

Women produce testosterone too—about 1/10th the amount men do, but it matters. Testosterone affects energy, libido, muscle mass, and mood. It declines gradually throughout adulthood, with a steeper drop after menopause. Many symptoms attributed to estrogen loss are actually testosterone-related. 

Learn more about testosterone for women → 
#### FSH & LH 

Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) are produced by the pituitary to stimulate the ovaries. As the ovaries become less responsive, FSH rises—the body is "shouting louder" to try to trigger ovulation. Elevated FSH is often used to confirm menopause. 
### TREATMENT OPTIONS 
#### Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) 

The most effective treatment for menopausal symptoms. Modern HRT has evolved significantly from what was studied in the early 2000s. 

**Important: **The 2002 Women's Health Initiative study that caused widespread fear of HRT has been re-analyzed and largely reversed. For most women under 60 or within 10 years of menopause, benefits outweigh risks. 

Read our full breakdown of the WHI study → 

- **Estrogen: **Most effective for hot flashes, sleep, mood. Can be delivered via patch, gel, pill, or pellet. 
- **Progesterone: **Required if you have a uterus (protects against endometrial cancer). Also helps with sleep and mood. 
- **Testosterone: **Often overlooked for women. Can help with energy, libido, muscle mass, and cognitive function. 
- **Bioidentical vs Synthetic: **Bioidentical hormones are molecularly identical to what your body produces. Many women prefer them, though both can be effective. 
#### Non-Hormonal Options 

- **SSRIs/SNRIs: **Can help with hot flashes and mood (paroxetine is FDA-approved for hot flashes). 
- **Gabapentin: **Sometimes used for hot flashes, especially at night. 
- **Vaginal estrogen: **Very low-dose, localized treatment for genitourinary symptoms. Minimal systemic absorption. 
- **Lifestyle: **Exercise, stress management, avoiding triggers (alcohol, caffeine, spicy food). 
#### What We Do at Moonshot 

We take a comprehensive approach. That means: 

- Full hormone panel (not just FSH and estrogen) 
- Metabolic markers ( thyroid , insulin, inflammation) 
- Symptom assessment alongside labs 
- Individualized protocols based on your specific situation 
- Ongoing monitoring and adjustment 
### WHEN TO SEEK HELP 
#### Consider evaluation if you have: 

- Hot flashes disrupting sleep or daily life 
- Mood changes affecting relationships or work 
- Brain fog impacting cognitive function 
- Weight gain despite unchanged habits 
- Low libido or painful intercourse 
- Irregular periods (before menopause) 
- Family history of osteoporosis or heart disease 
#### Seek prompt attention for: 

- Bleeding after menopause 
- Severe depression or anxiety 
- Symptoms before age 40 (premature menopause) 
- Chest pain or palpitations

### Progesterone: The Forgotten Hormone
URL: https://moonshotmp.com/learn/progesterone/

WOMEN'S HEALTH 
## Progesterone: 
The Forgotten Hormone 

It's not just about pregnancy. Progesterone affects your sleep, mood, anxiety, and overall hormonal balance. 
### More Than a "Pregnancy Hormone" 

When most people think of progesterone, they think of pregnancy and fertility. That's fair—progesterone does prepare the uterine lining for implantation and supports early pregnancy. But reducing it to "the pregnancy hormone" misses the bigger picture. 

Progesterone has receptors throughout your brain and body. It affects your nervous system, your sleep architecture , your mood, and your sense of calm. When progesterone drops—whether from anovulatory cycles, perimenopause , or stress—the effects go far beyond fertility. 

Understanding progesterone is essential for understanding why you might feel anxious, sleep poorly, or feel "off" even when estrogen levels look fine. 
### What Progesterone Actually Does 
#### Calms the Nervous System 

Progesterone metabolizes into allopregnanolone, a neurosteroid that acts on GABA receptors—the same receptors targeted by anti-anxiety medications and alcohol. This is why progesterone has a natural calming, anti-anxiety effect. When progesterone drops, many women experience increased anxiety, irritability, and a feeling of being "on edge." 
#### Supports Deep Sleep 

Through its GABA effects, progesterone promotes deeper, more restorative sleep. Women often notice sleep disturbances in the luteal phase (after ovulation) when progesterone should be high but isn't, and sleep problems are one of the first complaints in perimenopause when progesterone production becomes erratic. 
#### Balances Estrogen 

Estrogen and progesterone work in opposition. Estrogen stimulates and builds; progesterone calms and sheds. Without adequate progesterone to balance estrogen, you can develop " estrogen dominance "—not necessarily high estrogen, but estrogen that's unopposed. This leads to heavy periods, breast tenderness, bloating, and mood swings. 
#### Protects the Uterine Lining 

Estrogen causes the uterine lining to grow. Progesterone causes it to mature and shed in a controlled way. Without progesterone, the lining can become too thick (hyperplasia), which increases cancer risk over time. This is why women on estrogen therapy always need progesterone if they have a uterus. 
#### Supports Mood Stability 

Beyond its anti-anxiety effects, progesterone influences serotonin and other neurotransmitters. Low progesterone is associated with increased depression and mood volatility. Many women notice significant mood changes in the days before their period when progesterone drops sharply. 
### When Progesterone Drops: The Symptoms 

Low progesterone—or a poor progesterone-to-estrogen ratio—can cause a wide range of symptoms that are often attributed to other causes: 
#### Sleep Issues 

- Difficulty falling asleep 
- Waking at 2-4am 
- Light, unrefreshing sleep 
- Vivid dreams or nightmares 
#### Mood & Mental 

- Anxiety without clear cause 
- Irritability, low patience 
- Depression or flat mood 
- Brain fog, poor concentration 
#### Menstrual Changes 

- Heavy or prolonged periods 
- Spotting before period starts 
- Short luteal phase (<10 days) 
- Irregular cycles 
#### Physical Symptoms 

- Breast tenderness 
- Bloating, water retention 
- Headaches (especially premenstrual) 
- Weight gain (especially midsection) 

Many women are told these symptoms are "just stress" or "just PMS." While stress absolutely affects hormones, these symptoms often have a clear hormonal driver that can be measured and addressed. 
### Why Progesterone Declines 
#### Anovulatory Cycles 

Progesterone is produced by the corpus luteum—the structure that forms after ovulation. No ovulation = no corpus luteum = no significant progesterone production. Anovulatory cycles are common with PCOS , high stress, under-eating, over-exercising, and in perimenopause. 
#### Perimenopause 

Progesterone is the first hormone to decline in perimenopause—often years before estrogen drops. This is why perimenopausal symptoms often start with sleep issues, anxiety, and cycle changes rather than hot flashes. Many women in their late 30s and 40s have declining progesterone while estrogen remains normal or even high. 
#### Chronic Stress 

Cortisol (the stress hormone) and progesterone share a precursor: pregnenolone. Under chronic stress, your body prioritizes cortisol production over progesterone—a phenomenon sometimes called "pregnenolone steal." High stress literally diverts resources away from progesterone production. 
#### Luteal Phase Deficiency 

Even when ovulation occurs, the corpus luteum may not produce adequate progesterone. This can result from poor follicle development, thyroid issues, or other factors. The result is a short luteal phase (less than 10 days) and low progesterone symptoms despite ovulating. 
### Testing Progesterone 

Timing matters enormously when testing progesterone. In cycling women, progesterone is only elevated in the luteal phase (after ovulation). Testing on day 3 of your cycle will show low progesterone because it's supposed to be low then. 
#### When to Test 

For cycling women: Test progesterone 5-7 days after ovulation (approximately day 19-21 of a 28-day cycle, or 7 days before expected period). 

For perimenopausal or menopausal women: Timing is less critical as cycles are irregular or absent. Random testing can still provide useful information. 
#### What Levels Mean 

**Mid-luteal progesterone (day 21): **

- <3 ng/mL: Likely anovulatory 
- 3-10 ng/mL: Ovulation occurred, but may be suboptimal 
- 10-20 ng/mL: Normal, healthy luteal function 
- >20 ng/mL: Robust progesterone production 

Note: "Normal" lab ranges are very wide. A level of 5 ng/mL may be flagged as "normal" but still associated with symptoms and fertility issues. 
### Progesterone Replacement Options 
#### Oral Micronized Progesterone (Prometrium) 

Bioidentical progesterone taken by mouth. Has strong sedative/sleep effects due to first-pass liver metabolism (produces more allopregnanolone). Typically taken at bedtime. This is the form with the most evidence for cardiovascular and breast safety when used with estrogen therapy. 
#### Topical/Vaginal Progesterone 

Creams, gels, or vaginal suppositories. Bypasses liver metabolism, so less sedation but also less systemic effect. Vaginal application provides good uterine protection. Topical creams have variable absorption and may not provide adequate levels for some purposes. 
#### Progestins (Synthetic) 

Synthetic versions like medroxyprogesterone (Provera) are NOT the same as bioidentical progesterone. They protect the uterus but don't provide the neurological benefits and may have different risk profiles. The WHI study used Provera, not bioidentical progesterone—an important distinction. 

**Important: **Progesterone therapy should be individualized based on symptoms, lab values, and whether you still have a uterus. Cycling women may benefit from luteal-phase-only supplementation; post-menopausal women on estrogen need continuous progesterone for uterine protection. 
### Supporting Progesterone Naturally 

While replacement is sometimes necessary, supporting your body's own progesterone production can help—especially for cycling women with luteal phase issues: 
#### Manage Stress 

Chronic cortisol elevation competes with progesterone production. Stress management isn't just self-care—it's hormone care. 
#### Eat Enough 

Under-eating and over-exercising suppress ovulation. Your body won't prioritize reproduction (and progesterone) if it senses scarcity. 
#### Support Thyroid Function 

Hypothyroidism is associated with anovulation and luteal phase defects. Optimal thyroid function supports healthy progesterone production. 
#### Key Nutrients 

Vitamin B6, zinc, magnesium , and vitamin C support corpus luteum function and progesterone synthesis. Deficiencies are common.

### PCOS: Beyond the Diagnosis
URL: https://moonshotmp.com/learn/pcos/

WOMEN'S HEALTH 
## PCOS: 
Beyond the Diagnosis 

It's not one condition—it's several with different root causes. Understanding your type changes everything. 
### More Than Just "Cysts on Your Ovaries" 

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is the most common hormonal disorder in women of reproductive age, affecting 8-13% of women. Yet it's also one of the most misunderstood and poorly treated conditions. 

First, the name is misleading. You don't need cysts to have PCOS, and having cysts doesn't mean you have PCOS. The "cysts" are actually immature follicles that never developed enough to ovulate—a consequence of the hormonal dysfunction, not the cause. 

Second, PCOS isn't a single disease with a single cause. It's an umbrella diagnosis that can result from several different underlying mechanisms. Treating all PCOS the same way is why so many women don't get better. 
### How PCOS Is Diagnosed 

The Rotterdam criteria (most widely used) require **2 of 3 **features: 1 
#### Irregular or Absent Ovulation 

Cycles longer than 35 days, fewer than 8 periods per year, or no periods at all. 2 
#### High Androgens 

Either elevated testosterone/DHEA on labs OR clinical signs like acne, hirsutism (male-pattern hair growth), or hair loss. 3 
#### Polycystic Ovaries on Ultrasound 

12+ follicles per ovary or ovarian volume >10mL. (Note: Up to 25% of normal women have polycystic-appearing ovaries.) 

**Important: **Other conditions that cause similar symptoms must be ruled out first— thyroid disease , hyperprolactinemia, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and Cushing's syndrome. 
### The Different Types of PCOS 

This is where most treatment fails. A woman with insulin-resistant PCOS needs different interventions than one with adrenal PCOS or post-pill PCOS. Here are the main types: 
#### 1. Insulin-Resistant PCOS 

**The most common type (70% of cases). **High insulin drives the ovaries to produce excess androgens and disrupts ovulation. Often associated with weight gain, but can occur in lean women too. 
##### Signs & Labs 

- Elevated fasting insulin (>10 μIU/mL) 
- High triglycerides, low HDL 
- Acanthosis nigricans (dark skin patches) 
- Weight concentrated around midsection 
- Sugar/carb cravings 
##### Key Interventions 

- Blood sugar management (diet, exercise) 
- Metformin or inositol 
- Strength training 
- Weight loss (if overweight) 
- GLP-1 medications in some cases 
#### 2. Adrenal PCOS 

**About 20-30% of cases. **Elevated DHEA-S (an adrenal androgen) with normal testosterone. Often driven by stress and HPA axis dysfunction rather than insulin. 
##### Signs & Labs 

- Elevated DHEA-S, normal testosterone 
- Normal insulin and metabolic markers 
- Often lean body type 
- History of chronic stress 
- Wired-but-tired feeling 
##### Key Interventions 

- Stress reduction (critical) 
- Adequate sleep 
- Adaptogenic herbs (ashwagandha) 
- NOT aggressive dieting/fasting 
- Sometimes low-dose cortisol support 
#### 3. Inflammatory PCOS 

Chronic inflammation drives androgen production and disrupts ovulation. Often overlaps with insulin resistance, but inflammation is the primary driver. 
##### Signs & Labs 

- Elevated hsCRP 
- Skin issues (eczema, rashes) 
- Digestive issues, IBS 
- Joint pain, headaches 
- Fatigue disproportionate to other labs 
##### Key Interventions 

- Anti-inflammatory diet 
- Gut health optimization 
- Identify food sensitivities 
- Omega-3s, turmeric 
- Address environmental toxins 
#### 4. Post-Pill PCOS 

Temporary PCOS-like symptoms after stopping hormonal birth control. The pill suppresses your own hormone production; it can take time for normal cycling to resume. 
##### Signs 

- Regular cycles before the pill 
- PCOS symptoms only after stopping 
- Often resolves within 3-12 months 
- May have elevated LH:FSH ratio 
- Usually no insulin resistance 
##### Key Interventions 

- Time (often resolves on its own) 
- Support ovulation recovery 
- Zinc, B vitamins 
- Avoid rushing back to the pill 
- Cycle tracking to monitor recovery 
### The PCOS Hormone Pattern 

Understanding the hormonal cascade helps explain why symptoms cluster together: 
#### High LH, Low/Normal FSH 

The LH:FSH ratio is often elevated (2:1 or higher). High LH stimulates the ovaries to produce androgens. Low FSH means follicles don't mature properly for ovulation. 
#### Elevated Androgens 

Total testosterone, free testosterone, and/or DHEA-S may be elevated. This causes acne, hirsutism, and hair loss. It also disrupts the normal follicle development. 
#### Low Progesterone 

Without ovulation, there's no corpus luteum to produce progesterone . This leads to estrogen dominance , irregular bleeding, and increased endometrial cancer risk over time. 
#### Often: High Insulin 

Insulin stimulates androgen production and lowers SHBG (meaning more free testosterone). This creates a vicious cycle—high insulin drives PCOS, and PCOS worsens insulin resistance . 
### Treatment: Beyond "Just Take the Pill" 

The standard treatment for PCOS is birth control pills. They work—they suppress your hormones and create artificial "periods." But they don't fix anything. They mask the problem while the underlying dysfunction continues. 

When you stop the pill, everything comes back. Often worse, because the root cause was never addressed. 
#### A Better Approach 
##### 1. Identify Your Type 

Comprehensive labs including fasting insulin, DHEA-S, testosterone (free and total), SHBG, thyroid panel, and inflammatory markers. Don't guess—test. 
##### 2. Address Insulin Resistance (If Present) 

Dietary changes (lower glycemic load), strength training, metformin, and/or inositol. Weight loss of even 5-10% can restore ovulation in insulin-resistant PCOS. 
##### 3. Support Ovulation 

Once the underlying driver is addressed, ovulation often returns. If not, options like letrozole or clomiphene can help. The goal is restoring natural cycling, not suppressing it. 
##### 4. Manage Symptoms While Working on Root Cause 

Spironolactone for acne/hirsutism, topical treatments, laser hair removal. These don't fix PCOS but improve quality of life while you address the underlying issues. 
##### 5. Protect the Uterus 

Without regular ovulation, the uterine lining isn't shed properly. If you're not restoring cycles, cyclic progesterone (or yes, sometimes the pill) prevents endometrial hyperplasia. 
### PCOS and Long-Term Health 

PCOS isn't just about irregular periods and acne. It's associated with increased risk of several serious conditions: 
#### Metabolic Risks 

- Type 2 diabetes (4-7x increased risk) 
- Metabolic syndrome 
- Cardiovascular disease 
- Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease 
#### Other Risks 

- Endometrial cancer (2-6x increased) 
- Depression and anxiety 
- Sleep apnea 
- Infertility and pregnancy complications 

This is why treating the root cause matters—not just for fertility or cosmetic concerns, but for long-term health. 
### Labs to Request 

If you suspect PCOS or want to understand your type better, these are the key labs: 
#### Hormones 

- LH and FSH (day 2-4 of cycle) 
- Total and free testosterone 
- DHEA-S 
- SHBG 
- Estradiol 
- Progesterone (day 21) 
- AMH (ovarian reserve) 
#### Metabolic & Other 

- Fasting insulin 
- Fasting glucose 
- HbA1c 
- Lipid panel

### HRT Myths vs Facts

Women's Health 
## HRT: MYTHS VS FACTS 

In 2002, the Women's Health Initiative study created a generation of fear around hormone replacement therapy. Here's what actually happened—and what the science shows now. 
### WHAT HAPPENED IN 2002 

July 2002. Headlines around the world announced that hormone replacement therapy causes breast cancer, heart attacks, and strokes. The Women's Health Initiative (WHI)—one of the largest studies of its kind—had been stopped early because the risks were deemed too high. 

Within months, millions of women stopped taking HRT. Prescriptions dropped by 50%. Doctors stopped recommending it. Women suffering through menopause were told to tough it out—that hormones were too dangerous. 

**This was a massive overcorrection based on misinterpreted data. **

It took years for the medical community to fully understand what went wrong. By then, a generation of women had been denied effective treatment for menopausal symptoms, and the fear persists to this day. 
### WHAT THE WHI ACTUALLY SHOWED 
#### The Headlines Said: 

- "26% increased risk of breast cancer" 
- "29% increased risk of heart attack" 
- "41% increased risk of stroke" 

These are relative risks—and they're misleading. 
#### The Absolute Numbers: 

- Breast cancer: 38 vs 30 per 10,000 women/year 
- Heart attack: 37 vs 30 per 10,000 women/year 
- Stroke: 29 vs 21 per 10,000 women/year 

8 additional cases per 10,000 women per year. 
#### Putting It In Perspective 

The absolute risk increase was approximately **0.08% **per year. That means for every 10,000 women taking HRT for one year, about 8 additional women would experience one of these events compared to placebo. 

For comparison: the risk of dying in a car accident is about 0.01% per year. The risk from obesity is far higher. The risk from not treating severe menopausal symptoms (depression, insomnia, reduced quality of life) was never quantified. 
### THE PROBLEMS WITH THE WHI 
#### 1. Wrong Population 

The average age of participants was **63 years old **. Most were 10-20 years past menopause. The study was designed to test whether HRT could prevent heart disease in older women—not to assess its use for menopausal symptom relief in younger women. 

Starting hormones in a 63-year-old is very different from starting in a 51-year-old. This matters enormously. 
#### 2. Wrong Hormones 

The study used **Premarin **(conjugated equine estrogen—derived from pregnant horse urine) plus **Provera **(medroxyprogesterone acetate—a synthetic progestin). These are not bioidentical hormones. 

Modern HRT often uses bioidentical estradiol and micronized progesterone, which have different risk profiles. The WHI results may not apply to these formulations. 
#### 3. Wrong Route 

The study used **oral estrogen **. Oral estrogen passes through the liver and increases clotting factors. Transdermal estrogen (patches, gels, creams) bypasses the liver and does not increase clot risk. 

The blood clot and stroke findings may be specific to oral administration. 
#### 4. Data Was Presented Misleadingly 

Relative risk increases (26%, 29%, 41%) sound alarming. Absolute risk increases (0.08% per year) do not. The media reported relative risks. Most doctors and patients never saw the absolute numbers. 
### WHAT WE KNOW NOW 
#### The Timing Hypothesis Is Real 

Starting HRT within 10 years of menopause or before age 60 is associated with **cardiovascular benefit **, not harm. The WHI itself showed this when the data was reanalyzed by age group. Women who started HRT in their 50s had better outcomes than those who started in their 60s or 70s.¹ 
#### 18-Year Follow-Up: No Increased Mortality 

In 2017, JAMA published 18-year follow-up data from the WHI. The conclusion: **no significant difference in all-cause mortality **between women who took HRT and those who didn't. For women who took estrogen-only (no progestin), there was actually a trend toward *lower *mortality.² 
#### Estrogen-Only Showed Different Results 

The WHI had two arms: estrogen + progestin (for women with a uterus) and estrogen-only (for women who had hysterectomies). The estrogen-only arm showed **no increased breast cancer risk **—in fact, it showed a decrease. Most of the breast cancer risk appears to be from the synthetic progestin (Provera), not estrogen itself.³ 
#### Major Medical Societies Have Updated Positions 

The North American Menopause Society, the Endocrine Society, and international menopause societies now endorse HRT for symptomatic women under 60 or within 10 years of menopause. The benefits are considered to outweigh the risks for most women in this group.⁴ 
### COMMON MYTHS VS FACTS Myth 

"HRT causes breast cancer." Fact 

Estrogen-only HRT showed no increased breast cancer risk in the WHI—and possibly a decrease. The risk appears related to synthetic progestins (not bioidentical progesterone) with long-term use (5+ years). The absolute risk increase is small (about 1 additional case per 1,000 women per year with combined therapy). Myth 

"HRT causes heart attacks." Fact 

In older women starting HRT many years after menopause, there may be increased cardiovascular risk. But in younger women starting near menopause (the "timing hypothesis"), HRT is associated with cardiovascular protection. This is now well-established. Myth 

"You should use HRT for the shortest time possible." Fact 

This recommendation was based on WHI data that didn't account for timing or type of hormones. For women who start HRT near menopause and tolerate it well, there's no arbitrary time limit. Duration should be individualized based on ongoing benefits and risks. Myth 

"Bioidentical hormones are unproven or dangerous." Fact 

FDA-approved bioidentical estradiol and micronized progesterone exist and are well-studied. "Bioidentical" simply means molecularly identical to human hormones. Compounded bioidentical hormones have less regulatory oversight, but the hormones themselves are the same ones your body produces. Myth 

"Menopause symptoms are just something women have to endure." Fact 

Effective, safe treatment exists. The WHI's misinterpretation led a generation of women to suffer unnecessarily. Hot flashes, sleep disruption , mood changes, and other symptoms can significantly impact quality of life—and there are evidence-based solutions. 
### THE REAL TAKEAWAY 

The WHI wasn't wrong—it was misinterpreted and over-generalized. The study asked whether HRT could prevent heart disease in older postmenopausal women. The answer was no (and it might increase risk in that population). 

But that's a very different question from whether HRT is safe and beneficial for symptomatic women in their 50s starting near menopause. For that population, the evidence now supports HRT as first-line treatment. 

The decision to use HRT should be individualized—based on your symptoms, health history, family history, and preferences. It's not one-size-fits-all. But it's also not the blanket danger it was made out to be in 2002.

### Semaglutide vs Tirzepatide: How to Choose
URL: https://moonshotmp.com/learn/semaglutide-vs-tirzepatide/

← Back to Learn 

Weight Loss 
## SEMAGLUTIDE VS TIRZEPATIDE 

Two medications. Different mechanisms. Both produce significant weight loss. Here's how they compare and how to decide. 
### HEAD-TO-HEAD Semaglutide Tirzepatide Brand Names Ozempic, Wegovy, Rybelsus Mounjaro, Zepbound Mechanism GLP-1 receptor agonist GLP-1 + GIP dual agonist Avg Weight Loss 15–20% 20–25% FDA Approved For Diabetes (Ozempic), Weight loss (Wegovy) Diabetes (Mounjaro), Weight loss (Zepbound) Injection Frequency Once weekly Once weekly Manufacturer Novo Nordisk Eli Lilly Available Since 2017 (Ozempic) 2022 (Mounjaro) 
### HOW THEY WORK (AND WHY IT MATTERS) 

Both medications mimic gut hormones that your body produces naturally after eating. The difference is which hormones they mimic. 
#### Semaglutide 

GLP-1 Agonist 

Mimics GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1), a hormone released by your gut after eating. GLP-1 does three things: 

- 1. **Signals fullness to the brain **— reduces appetite and food noise 
- 2. **Slows gastric emptying **— food stays in your stomach longer, so you feel full longer 
- 3. **Improves insulin sensitivity **— better blood sugar regulation 

Semaglutide is a modified version of natural GLP-1 that lasts much longer in the body (natural GLP-1 breaks down in minutes; semaglutide lasts about a week). 
#### Tirzepatide 

GLP-1 + GIP Dual Agonist 

Does everything semaglutide does, plus mimics a second hormone: GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide). 

- + **GIP enhances insulin secretion **— additional blood sugar control 
- + **GIP affects fat metabolism **— may promote fat burning and reduce fat storage 
- + **Potentially more satiety signaling **— two pathways instead of one 

Think of it as a two-key approach. Semaglutide turns one lock. Tirzepatide turns two. Both open the door, but the dual mechanism may produce a stronger overall effect. 

**What this means practically: **Tirzepatide tends to produce more weight loss in clinical trials. But biology is individual—some people respond better to one mechanism than the other. "Better on average" doesn't mean "better for you." 
### WHAT THE CLINICAL TRIALS SHOW 
#### Semaglutide — STEP Trials 

The STEP (Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with Obesity) program enrolled over 4,500 participants across multiple trials. 

-14.9% 

Avg body weight loss (STEP 1) 

83% 

Lost at least 5% body weight

Trial duration 
#### Tirzepatide — SURMOUNT Trials 

The SURMOUNT program studied tirzepatide for weight management in over 5,000 participants.

**Context: **Clinical trial participants also received lifestyle intervention (diet and exercise counseling). Real-world results may differ. These numbers represent averages—some people lose more, some lose less. The data shows tirzepatide has an edge at the highest doses, but both produce clinically meaningful weight loss far beyond what lifestyle alone typically achieves. 
### WHAT TO EXPECT: MONTH BY MONTH 

Both medications follow a similar timeline. You start at a low dose and titrate up over several months to reach your target dose. Here's the general trajectory. 

Month 

1–2 
#### Starting Dose — Adjustment Phase 

You'll start at the lowest dose. Appetite reduction begins—many people notice less "food noise" (constant thinking about food) within the first week or two. GI side effects are most common during this phase: nausea, mild stomach discomfort, sometimes constipation. These typically improve as your body adjusts. Weight loss: 2–5 lbs. 

Month 

3–4 
#### Dose Titration — Momentum Builds 

Dose increases to the next level. Appetite suppression is more consistent and pronounced. Most people find portion sizes drop naturally—you just don't want as much food. Side effects typically improve or become manageable. Weight loss accelerates: 8–15 lbs total. This is when most people start noticing visible changes. 

Month 

5–8 
#### Target Dose — Steady State 

You've reached (or are approaching) your target dose. Weight loss is steady—typically 1–2 lbs per week. Energy levels often improve as weight decreases. Metabolic markers start improving: blood sugar, triglycerides, blood pressure. This is the productive middle phase. Total loss: 20–40 lbs depending on starting weight. 

Month 

9–12+ 
#### Approaching Maximum — Plateau Management 

Weight loss rate slows as your body approaches a new equilibrium. This is normal—it's not the medication "stopping working." Your body adapts to its new weight. Focus shifts to maintenance, habit consolidation, and body composition optimization. Total loss typically reaches 15–25% of starting body weight. 

**Individual variation is real. **Some people respond rapidly at lower doses. Others need the full titration to see significant results. Some respond well to semaglutide but not tirzepatide, or vice versa. This is why medical oversight matters—adjusting dose, timing, and even switching medications when needed. 
### SIDE EFFECTS COMPARED 

Both medications share similar side effect profiles because they work on the same pathways. The most common side effects are gastrointestinal. 
#### Common (Both Medications) 

Nausea 

Most common side effect. Usually worst during dose increases. Typically improves within 2-4 weeks at each dose level. 

Constipation or Diarrhea 

GI motility changes affect bowel habits. Often manageable with hydration and fiber. 

Reduced Appetite 

This is the intended effect, but some people experience it more intensely—feeling no desire to eat at all. You still need to eat adequate protein. 

Injection Site Reactions 

Mild redness or discomfort at injection site. Usually minor. 
#### Less Common but Notable 

Fatigue 

Some people experience tiredness, especially early on. Often related to reduced caloric intake rather than the medication itself. 

Headache 

May occur during dose titration. Usually temporary. 

Gallbladder Issues 

Rapid weight loss (from any cause) increases gallstone risk. Uncommon but worth monitoring. 

Pancreatitis 

Rare but serious. Symptoms include severe abdominal pain radiating to the back. Seek medical attention immediately. 

**Key difference: **Side effect rates are roughly comparable between semaglutide and tirzepatide in clinical trials. Some patients tolerate one better than the other—this is individual. If side effects are intolerable on one, switching to the other is a reasonable option. 
### THE MUSCLE LOSS QUESTION 

This is the biggest concern people have about GLP-1 medications, and it deserves a straight answer. 

Yes, you will lose some muscle mass on GLP-1 medications. But context matters: you lose muscle mass with any method of rapid weight loss. Calorie restriction, bariatric surgery, GLP-1s—all of them result in some lean mass loss alongside fat loss. This isn't unique to GLP-1 medications. 
#### The Numbers 

In clinical trials, approximately 25-40% of total weight lost on GLP-1 medications was lean mass (muscle + other non-fat tissue). The rest was fat. 

For comparison: 

- Calorie-restricted dieting: ~25-30% lean mass loss 
- Bariatric surgery: ~25-35% lean mass loss 
- GLP-1 medications: ~25-40% lean mass loss 

The ranges overlap significantly. GLP-1s may be slightly higher because the weight loss is more rapid and dramatic. 
#### How to Minimize Muscle Loss 
##### Strength Training 

This is the single most important factor. Resistance training 2-4x per week sends a "keep this muscle" signal to your body even while losing weight. The stimulus tells your body to preferentially burn fat instead. 
##### High Protein Intake 

Aim for 0.7–1.0 grams of protein per pound of body weight daily. This is harder on GLP-1s because your appetite is suppressed—you need to prioritize protein even when you don't feel like eating. Protein is the building material your muscles need to survive a calorie deficit. 
##### Track Body Composition 

The scale doesn't tell you what you're losing. A DEXA scan shows exactly how much is fat vs lean mass. If lean mass is dropping too fast, your protocol needs adjusting—more protein, more training, or a slower rate of loss. 
##### Don't Undershoot Calories 

GLP-1s can suppress appetite so aggressively that some people barely eat. Extreme caloric restriction accelerates muscle loss. You should still eat—aim for a moderate deficit with adequate protein, not starvation-level intake. 

**Our approach: **Every weight loss patient at Moonshot gets baseline DEXA scanning to track body composition over time. We're not just watching the number on the scale go down—we're monitoring what kind of weight you're losing. If muscle loss is excessive, we adjust the plan. 
### WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU STOP? 

This is the question everyone should ask before starting. The honest answer: most people regain a significant portion of the weight after stopping GLP-1 medications. 

The STEP 1 trial extension showed that participants who stopped semaglutide regained about two-thirds of the weight they lost within one year. Tirzepatide data shows a similar pattern. 

This isn't a failure of willpower. It's biology. These medications work by overriding your body's weight defense mechanisms—hunger hormones, metabolic adaptation, appetite signaling. When you stop the medication, those mechanisms return to their baseline settings. 
#### What This Means for Your Plan 

**Option 1: Long-term use. **Some patients stay on GLP-1 medications long-term at maintenance doses. This is increasingly recognized as a valid approach for obesity management, similar to how blood pressure or cholesterol medications are used long-term. 

**Option 2: Use as a bridge. **Use the medication to lose weight while building exercise and nutrition habits. Taper off gradually and rely on lifestyle changes. Some weight regain is likely but not all—especially if you've maintained muscle and built real habits. 

**Option 3: Cycle on and off. **Use the medication in defined periods, maintain with lifestyle between cycles. Less studied but commonly practiced. 
### HOW TO CHOOSE 
#### Semaglutide might be a better fit if: 

- You want the medication with the longest track record (available since 2017) 
- Your insurance covers it (semaglutide has broader insurance coverage currently) 
- You've tried tirzepatide and experienced intolerable side effects 
- You prefer an oral option (Rybelsus is available as a daily pill, though the injectable form is more effective for weight loss) 
#### Tirzepatide might be a better fit if: 

- You want the highest average weight loss based on clinical data 
- You have significant insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes (the dual mechanism may provide better blood sugar control) 
- Semaglutide wasn't effective enough at maximum dose 
- You want to maximize results and the cost difference isn't a barrier 
#### The truth: 

Both work well. For most people, the deciding factors end up being availability, cost/insurance coverage, and individual side effect tolerance. If one doesn't work optimally, you can switch to the other. This isn't a permanent decision. 
### COMMON QUESTIONS 
#### Can I take a GLP-1 if I'm not obese? 

FDA approval is for BMI 30+ (or 27+ with weight-related conditions). However, off-label use for lower BMIs is possible when there's a clinical rationale. This is a conversation for your provider based on your specific health picture. 
#### Will I need to inject myself? 

Yes. Both are weekly subcutaneous injections using a pre-filled pen—similar to insulin pens. The needle is very small and the injection is just under the skin (not into muscle). Most patients are comfortable with self-injection after the first time. 
#### Can I drink alcohol on GLP-1 medications? 

There's no strict prohibition, but many patients report lower alcohol tolerance and increased nausea with alcohol. GLP-1s slow gastric emptying, so alcohol absorption patterns may change. Many patients naturally drink less because they just don't want it. Excessive alcohol should be avoided as it adds empty calories and can worsen GI side effects. 
#### How much does it cost at Moonshot? 

Our full Weight Loss program is $405/month (includes medication, medical oversight, labs, DEXA tracking, and dose management). If your insurance covers the GLP-1 medication, we offer a Prescription Program at $105/month for oversight and monitoring.

### Peptides Explained: What They Are, How They Work & What's Legal
URL: https://moonshotmp.com/learn/peptides/

← Back to Learn 

Peptides & Performance 
## PEPTIDES EXPLAINED 

What they are, how long they've been around, why some got banned, and why what you buy online might not be what you think it is. 
### WHAT ARE PEPTIDES? 

Peptides are short chains of amino acids. Think of amino acids as letters and peptides as words—short sequences that carry a specific message. Proteins are the full sentences and paragraphs. 

Technically, a peptide is any chain of 2 to about 50 amino acids. Above that, it's generally called a protein. Your body makes thousands of peptides naturally—insulin is a peptide, oxytocin is a peptide, the endorphins you feel after a workout are peptides. 

Therapeutic peptides are lab-made versions of these natural signaling molecules. They work by binding to specific receptors in your body and triggering a targeted response: release more growth hormone, repair gut tissue, increase blood flow, reduce inflammation. The specificity is the appeal—peptides can do one thing precisely, with fewer off-target effects than broad-acting drugs. 

**Key distinction: **Peptides aren't steroids, aren't hormones (though some trigger hormone release), and aren't supplements. They're signaling molecules—they tell your body to do something it already knows how to do. 
### PEPTIDES AREN'T NEW 

The internet makes peptides feel like a bleeding-edge discovery. They're not. Scientists have been studying peptides for over a century. 

1921 — Insulin Isolated 

Insulin—a 51-amino-acid peptide—was isolated by Banting and Best. It became the first peptide therapy and has been used continuously for over 100 years. This is where peptide medicine starts. 

1950s–1970s — Peptide Hormones Discovered 

Researchers identified dozens of naturally occurring peptides: oxytocin, vasopressin, growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), and many others. The understanding of peptides as the body's signaling system took shape. 

1980s — Growth Hormone Releasing Peptides 

Scientists developed synthetic peptides that could stimulate the pituitary gland to release growth hormone. This led to compounds like GHRP-6, GHRP-2, and eventually sermorelin—the first FDA-approved growth hormone releasing peptide (approved in 1997 as Geref). 

1990s — BPC-157 & Healing Peptides 

Dr. Predrag Sikiric's lab in Zagreb, Croatia began publishing research on BPC-157 (Body Protection Compound), a peptide derived from a protective protein found in gastric juice. Over 100 studies followed—mostly animal models—showing remarkable healing properties for tendons, ligaments, gut, and muscle. It became arguably the most popular peptide in the optimization world. 

2000s–2010s — Expansion & Clinical Pipelines 

Dozens of peptides entered pharmaceutical development pipelines. CJC-1295, ipamorelin, thymosin beta-4 (TB-500), AOD-9604, and others were studied in clinical trials for everything from growth hormone deficiency to wound healing to fat loss. Many showed promise in Phase I and II trials. 

2019 — PT-141 Gets FDA Approval 

Bremelanotide (PT-141) was approved by the FDA as Vyleesi for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in premenopausal women. It became one of the few modern peptides to complete the full FDA approval process. 

2023–2024 — FDA Crackdown on Compounding 

The FDA began removing peptides from compounding eligibility, effectively ending legal access to many popular compounds. BPC-157, thymosin alpha-1, thymosin beta-4, AOD-9604, and others were placed on the "cannot compound" list. 
### THE MOST TALKED-ABOUT PEPTIDES 

Here's what each one does, where it came from, and whether you can still legally get it through a medical provider. 
#### BPC-157 Not Available for Compounding 

Healing & Recovery 

**What it does: **Body Protection Compound-157 promotes healing of tendons, ligaments, muscle, gut lining, and potentially nerve tissue. It works by upregulating growth factor expression and promoting angiogenesis (new blood vessel formation) at injury sites. 

**The research: **Over 100 published studies, almost entirely in animal models. Results are remarkably consistent—accelerated healing across multiple tissue types. However, no human clinical trials have been completed. 

**Why it's not available: **The FDA determined that BPC-157 doesn't meet criteria for compounding under Section 503B. It has no history of use in compounding prior to 1998, no USP monograph, and no completed human trials supporting safety. The FDA finalized this decision in 2024. 
#### Sermorelin Available 

Growth Hormone Release 

**What it does: **Sermorelin is a growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) analog. It stimulates your pituitary gland to produce and release more of your own growth hormone, particularly during sleep . Benefits include improved sleep quality, body composition, recovery, skin elasticity, and overall vitality. 

**The research: **Sermorelin was FDA-approved in 1997 as Geref Diagnostic for growth hormone deficiency testing, and Geref for treatment of growth hormone deficiency in children. The manufacturer discontinued it voluntarily (business decision, not safety concern), but its extensive clinical history supports continued compounding. 

**Current status: **Sermorelin can be prescribed by a medical provider and produced by a licensed compounding pharmacy. Its prior FDA approval history gives it a stronger regulatory footing than peptides that were never approved. 
#### PT-141 (Bremelanotide) Available 

Sexual Health 

**What it does: **PT-141 works on the melanocortin system in the brain—not blood flow like Viagra/Cialis. It increases sexual desire and arousal at a neurological level. Works for both men and women. 

**The research: **Completed the full FDA approval process. Approved in 2019 as Vyleesi for hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in premenopausal women. Well-studied in clinical trials with over 1,200 participants. 

**Current status: **Fully FDA-approved and available through both brand-name prescription (Vyleesi) and compounding pharmacies. One of the few peptides with a complete safety and efficacy dataset. 
#### CJC-1295 & Ipamorelin Not Available for Compounding 

Growth Hormone Release 

**What they do: **CJC-1295 is a GHRH analog (similar to sermorelin) that stimulates growth hormone release. Ipamorelin is a growth hormone-releasing peptide (GHRP) that works through a different receptor. They were commonly combined ("CJC/Ipamorelin") for a synergistic effect on growth hormone output. 

**The research: **CJC-1295 was studied in Phase II clinical trials showing sustained growth hormone elevation. Ipamorelin was studied in multiple trials, including for post-operative ileus recovery. Both showed efficacy but neither completed the full approval process. 

**Why they're not available: **Neither met FDA criteria for compounding eligibility. CJC-1295 with DAC (Drug Affinity Complex) was specifically flagged. The FDA removed both from compounding availability in 2024. 
#### Thymosin Beta-4 (TB-500) Not Available for Compounding 

Healing & Recovery 

**What it does: **TB-500 promotes wound healing, reduces inflammation, and supports tissue repair. It upregulates actin, a cell-building protein involved in cell migration and tissue repair. Was popular for joint, tendon, and muscle injuries. 

**The research: **Studied in clinical trials for wound healing (particularly chronic skin wounds and corneal injuries). RegeneRx Biopharmaceuticals developed it through early clinical stages. Phase II trials showed promise for wound healing, but the company couldn't secure funding to continue through Phase III. 

**Why it's not available: **Removed from compounding eligibility by the FDA. Like BPC-157, it lacks the regulatory history and completed human trial data the FDA requires for bulk compounding status. 
#### Thymosin Alpha-1 Not Available for Compounding 

Immune Support 

**What it does: **Modulates and strengthens the immune system. Enhances T-cell function, natural killer cell activity, and overall immune surveillance. Used for immune deficiency, chronic infections, and as an adjunct in cancer treatment. 

**The research: **This one is particularly notable—thymosin alpha-1 is approved as a pharmaceutical drug (Zadaxin) in over 35 countries for hepatitis B and C treatment, and as an immune booster. It's one of the most well-studied peptides in existence, with decades of clinical data. 

**Why it's not available in the US: **Despite global approval, thymosin alpha-1 was never FDA-approved in the United States. The company (SciClone Pharmaceuticals) focused on international markets. When the FDA reviewed it for compounding eligibility, it didn't meet US-specific criteria. This is a case where FDA decisions don't reflect global medical consensus. 
#### AOD-9604 Not Available for Compounding 

Fat Loss 

**What it does: **AOD-9604 is a modified fragment of human growth hormone (amino acids 177-191). It was designed to have the fat-burning properties of growth hormone without the growth-promoting or blood sugar effects. 

**The research: **Developed by Monash University in Australia. Phase II clinical trials showed fat loss without the side effects of full HGH. However, Phase IIb results were mixed, and the drug failed to achieve its primary endpoints in larger trials. The company pivoted to studying it for osteoarthritis. 

**Why it's not available: **Never achieved FDA approval or met compounding criteria. Removed from compounding eligibility in 2024. 
### WHY PROMISING PEPTIDES STALL OUT 

Here's a pattern that repeats across the peptide landscape: a compound shows real promise in early trials, then disappears from the clinical pipeline. People assume this means it didn't work. Usually, it means nobody could fund what comes next. 

Getting a drug through FDA approval costs $1-2 billion on average and takes 10-15 years. For a pharmaceutical company, that investment only makes sense if they can patent the compound and recoup costs through exclusive sales. 

Peptides present a problem: many are naturally occurring or simple enough that strong patent protection is difficult. If you spend $1 billion getting BPC-157 through Phase III trials and FDA approval, a compounding pharmacy can immediately make a generic version. The economics don't work for traditional pharma. 
#### The Result 

Dozens of peptides sit in a regulatory limbo: enough published research to suggest they work, but not enough FDA-quality clinical trial data to satisfy US regulatory requirements. They're not "unproven"—they're "underfunded." 
#### The Catch-22 

Without FDA approval, these peptides can't be marketed for medical use. Without a financial incentive to pursue FDA approval, no company will fund the trials. Without trials, they can't be approved. The cycle continues. 
### HOW THE FDA DECIDES WHAT'S ALLOWED 

The FDA doesn't technically "ban" peptides. Here's what actually happens: 

Compounding pharmacies operate under Section 503A and 503B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. These sections allow pharmacies to create custom medications—but only using "bulk drug substances" that meet specific criteria. 

The FDA reviews nominated substances and places them into categories: Category 1 
#### Can Be Compounded 

The substance meets FDA criteria. Licensed compounding pharmacies can use it to fill prescriptions from medical providers. Examples: sermorelin. Category 2 
#### Under Review 

The substance has been nominated but FDA hasn't made a final determination. Status is uncertain and may change. Some pharmacies may still compound these while the review is pending. Category 3 
#### Cannot Be Compounded 

The substance doesn't meet FDA criteria. It cannot be legally compounded by 503B outsourcing facilities. This is what happened to BPC-157, TB-500, thymosin alpha-1, CJC-1295, ipamorelin, and others in 2024. 

**Important: **"Not eligible for compounding" doesn't mean the peptide is dangerous or doesn't work. It means the FDA determined it doesn't meet the specific regulatory criteria for bulk compounding under current law. The FDA has stated it will continue to revisit these decisions as new data becomes available. 
### THE "RESEARCH CHEMICAL" PROBLEM 

Search "BPC-157" online and you'll find dozens of websites selling peptides. Most display a disclaimer: "For research purposes only. Not for human consumption." This is how they operate in a legal gray area. 

Here's what you need to understand about these products: 
#### No Manufacturing Standards 

Licensed compounding pharmacies operate under FDA oversight with strict manufacturing standards (cGMP or comparable). Research chemical companies don't. There's no required testing for purity, potency, sterility, or endotoxins. Quality varies wildly between companies—and between batches from the same company. 
#### You Don't Know What's in the Vial 

Third-party testing of "research" peptides has found: wrong peptide entirely, incorrect concentrations (sometimes 50% under or over), bacterial endotoxins, heavy metal contamination, and residual solvents from manufacturing. When you inject something, you need to know exactly what it is. These products don't give you that certainty. 
#### No Dosing Guidance 

Research chemical companies can't legally provide dosing instructions for human use. So people piece together protocols from Reddit threads, YouTube videos, and forum posts. This is how you get wrong doses, wrong injection sites, wrong reconstitution methods, and wrong frequency. Peptide dosing matters—too little does nothing, too much causes side effects. 
#### No Medical Oversight 

Nobody is monitoring your labs, watching for interactions with other medications, checking for contraindications, or adjusting your protocol based on response. Self-administering injectable compounds without medical oversight is a risk most people underestimate until something goes wrong. 

**The bottom line: **The appeal is understandable—you've read about a peptide that could help, it's not available through your doctor, and someone online is selling it. But "research chemical" peptides are unregulated, untested, and injecting unknown substances into your body is a different category of risk than taking a questionable supplement. 
### CURRENT STATUS AT A GLANCE 

This landscape changes as the FDA continues its review process. Last updated early 2025. 
#### Available Through Medical Providers 

Sermorelin 

Growth hormone release. Previously FDA-approved. 

PT-141 / Bremelanotide 

Sexual health. FDA-approved as Vyleesi. 

Additional peptides may be available depending on compounding pharmacy and ongoing FDA determinations. Ask your provider about current options. 
#### Removed from Compounding (2024) 

BPC-157 

Healing & recovery 

CJC-1295 (with or without DAC) 

Growth hormone release 

Ipamorelin 

Growth hormone release 

Thymosin Beta-4 (TB-500) 

Healing & recovery 

Thymosin Alpha-1 

Immune support 

AOD-9604 

Fat loss 
### WHY SOURCING AND OVERSIGHT MATTER 

The difference between peptide therapy done right and peptide therapy done wrong comes down to two things: what's in the vial and who's guiding the protocol. 
#### Pharmaceutical-Grade Sourcing 

Licensed compounding pharmacies test for identity, purity, potency, sterility, and endotoxins. Every batch. This isn't optional—it's required by law. 
#### Proper Dosing Protocols 

Dose, frequency, timing, injection technique, and reconstitution all matter. A medical provider builds your protocol based on your goals, health status, and response. 
#### Monitoring & Adjustment 

Lab work before and during therapy. Checking for interactions. Adjusting based on response. This is the difference between "I'm taking a peptide" and "I'm on a managed protocol." 
### COMMON QUESTIONS 
#### Are peptides the same as steroids? 

No. Steroids are synthetic hormones (typically testosterone derivatives) that directly supply the hormone. Peptides are signaling molecules that tell your body to do something—like produce more growth hormone. They work through different mechanisms and have very different risk profiles. 
#### Are peptides safe? 

When sourced from a licensed pharmacy and used under medical supervision with proper dosing, peptides like sermorelin and PT-141 have good safety profiles. The risk increases dramatically when using unregulated "research" products without medical oversight. Safety is a function of the compound, the source, and the supervision. 
#### Will the FDA bring back any of the banned peptides? 

It's possible. The FDA has said it will revisit decisions as new data becomes available. If a peptide completes adequate clinical trials or if Congress changes compounding laws, some compounds could return to compounding eligibility. But there's no timeline, and it would require significant effort and investment to make it happen. 
#### What about oral peptides or peptide supplements? 

Most peptides are broken down by digestive enzymes before they can be absorbed, which is why most are injected. Some companies sell oral peptide "supplements"—these are generally not effective for the same reasons. There are exceptions (BPC-157 was originally studied as an oral compound for gut healing), but most peptide supplements you see marketed online don't deliver what they promise. 
#### How much do peptides cost through a medical provider? 

At Moonshot, peptide therapy (sermorelin or PT-141) is $250/month, which includes the peptide from a licensed compounding pharmacy and medical oversight. Costs vary by provider and peptide. Insurance does not typically cover peptide therapy.

### Thyroid Optimization: Why Normal Isn't Optimal

Hormones & Optimization 
## THYROID OPTIMIZATION 

Your thyroid controls metabolism, energy, mood, and body composition. Most standard testing misses dysfunction entirely. Here's what optimal actually looks like and why "normal" isn't good enough. 
### WHAT YOUR THYROID DOES 

The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland at the base of your neck, and it functions as the master regulator of your metabolism. It produces two primary hormones: thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). T4 is the storage form — it circulates in large quantities but is biologically inactive. T3 is the active form — it's what your cells actually use. About 80% of T3 is produced by converting T4 in peripheral tissues (liver, gut, kidneys, muscles), not by the thyroid gland itself. This conversion step is where a huge amount of dysfunction hides. 

Every cell in your body has thyroid hormone receptors. That's not hyperbole — it's physiology. T3 enters the cell nucleus and directly regulates gene transcription. This is why thyroid dysfunction affects virtually every system in the body and why the symptom list is so broad that it gets dismissed as "stress" or "aging." 

Here's what thyroid hormones directly regulate: 
#### Basal Metabolic Rate 

T3 sets the pace at which every cell burns fuel. Low T3 means fewer calories burned at rest, lower body temperature, and a sluggish metabolism that makes fat loss feel impossible even in a calorie deficit. 
#### Energy Production 

Thyroid hormones regulate mitochondrial function and ATP production. When thyroid output is low, your cells produce less energy. The result is fatigue that sleep doesn't fix — because the problem isn't rest, it's cellular energy output. 
#### Cognitive Function 

T3 directly affects neurotransmitter synthesis, neural myelination, and cerebral blood flow. Brain fog, poor concentration, memory issues, and slowed processing speed are hallmark symptoms of low thyroid function. 
#### Heart Rate & Cardiovascular Function 

T3 regulates heart rate, cardiac output, and vascular resistance. Hypothyroidism is directly linked to elevated LDL cholesterol, increased arterial stiffness, and higher cardiovascular risk — even at subclinical levels. 
#### Body Temperature Regulation 

Cold hands, cold feet, always needing an extra layer — this is a classic sign of suboptimal thyroid function. T3 drives thermogenesis. Low T3 means low heat production. 
#### Hair, Skin & Nail Health 

Thyroid hormones regulate keratinocyte and fibroblast activity. Hair thinning (especially the outer third of the eyebrow), dry skin, and brittle nails are among the earliest visible signs of thyroid dysfunction. 
#### Menstrual Regularity & Fertility 

Thyroid hormones influence GnRH pulsatility, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and progesterone production. Hypothyroidism is a documented cause of irregular periods, anovulation, and recurrent miscarriage. The American Thyroid Association recommends screening in women struggling with fertility. 
#### Cholesterol Metabolism & Bone Density 

T3 upregulates LDL receptors in the liver, increasing cholesterol clearance. Hypothyroidism raises LDL and total cholesterol. Thyroid hormones also regulate bone turnover — both deficiency and excess affect bone mineral density, making proper dosing critical. 

**The takeaway: **Your thyroid isn't just one system among many. It's the pacemaker for your entire metabolism. When it's off, everything downstream is off — energy, body composition, cognition, mood, cardiovascular health, and reproductive function. And because the symptoms overlap with so many other conditions, thyroid dysfunction is one of the most under-recognized problems in medicine. 
### WHY STANDARD TESTING MISSES THE PROBLEM 

Most doctors test only TSH. Some add Free T4. That's it. This is the standard of care in conventional medicine, and it misses a staggering amount of thyroid dysfunction. 

TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) is produced by the pituitary gland. When thyroid hormone levels drop, the pituitary releases more TSH to tell the thyroid to produce more. When thyroid levels are adequate, TSH drops. It's a feedback loop — and testing TSH alone tells you what the pituitary thinks about thyroid levels. It does not tell you how much active hormone is reaching your cells, whether you're converting T4 to T3 properly, whether reverse T3 is blocking your receptors, or whether your immune system is slowly destroying the gland. 

Testing only TSH is like checking the thermostat reading but never checking whether the furnace is actually producing heat, whether the ducts are open, or whether someone left a window open. The thermostat might read "fine" while you're freezing. 

TSH (Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone) 

The pituitary's signal to the thyroid. Tells you whether the brain thinks it's getting enough thyroid hormone. Useful, but it's an indirect marker. TSH can be "normal" while Free T3 is low, Reverse T3 is high, or antibodies are elevated. It also fluctuates throughout the day (lowest in the afternoon, highest in the early morning) and is suppressed by stress, cortisol, and certain medications. 

Free T4 (Free Thyroxine) 

The unbound, available form of the storage hormone. Most T4 in your blood is bound to proteins (mainly thyroxine-binding globulin, or TBG) and is biologically inactive. Free T4 is what's available for conversion to T3. Important to measure, but T4 is not the active hormone — it has to be converted. A patient with adequate Free T4 but poor conversion will still be functionally hypothyroid. 

Free T3 (Free Triiodothyronine) 

The active hormone. This is what actually enters your cells, binds to nuclear receptors, and drives metabolic activity. Free T3 is arguably the single most important thyroid marker for how you actually feel and function — and it's the one most commonly left off standard panels. You can have a "normal" TSH and Free T4 while your Free T3 is at the bottom of the range, leaving you fatigued, foggy, and gaining weight. 

Reverse T3 (rT3) 

An inactive metabolite of T4 that competes with T3 for receptor binding. Under stress, caloric restriction, inflammation, or illness, the body preferentially converts T4 to Reverse T3 instead of active T3. This is a protective mechanism — it slows metabolism when the body perceives threat. But in chronic stress, overdieting, or systemic inflammation, Reverse T3 stays elevated and effectively blocks your cells from using the T3 you do produce. High Reverse T3 with "normal" TSH and Free T4 is one of the most common patterns we see in patients who feel terrible but are told their thyroid is fine. 

TPO Antibodies (Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies) 

The primary marker for Hashimoto's thyroiditis — the autoimmune condition that is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in the developed world. Elevated TPO antibodies mean your immune system is attacking your thyroid gland. The damage is gradual. TSH may remain normal for years while the gland is slowly being destroyed. By the time TSH finally rises out of range, significant gland damage has already occurred. Early detection through antibody testing allows intervention before irreversible damage. 

Thyroglobulin Antibodies (TgAb) 

Another autoimmune marker. Some patients with Hashimoto's have elevated TgAb but normal TPO antibodies, so testing both increases diagnostic sensitivity. Thyroglobulin is a protein the thyroid uses to produce hormones — antibodies against it indicate immune-mediated gland destruction. 

**Why this matters: **A TSH-only test gives you one data point out of six. It's the medical equivalent of checking one tire on a car and declaring the vehicle safe to drive. You can have a TSH of 2.0 (perfectly "normal") and still have low Free T3, elevated Reverse T3, and positive TPO antibodies — meaning you're functionally hypothyroid, your cells are blocked from using the T3 you do make, and your immune system is destroying the gland. A comprehensive panel catches all of this. A TSH-only test catches none of it. 
### NORMAL VS. OPTIMAL RANGES 

Reference ranges on lab reports are derived from the statistical distribution of the testing population. That population includes the elderly, the obese, the chronically ill, and people with undiagnosed thyroid disease. The range represents where 95% of that population falls — not where people feel and function their best. 

Optimal ranges are based on clinical outcomes — the ranges where patients consistently report the best energy, cognition, body composition, and mood. The gap between "normal" and "optimal" is where most thyroid dysfunction lives, undiagnosed and untreated. Marker Standard "Normal" Range Optimal Range TSH 0.4 – 4.5 mIU/L 0.5 – 2.0 mIU/L Free T4 0.8 – 1.8 ng/dL 1.0 – 1.5 ng/dL Free T3 2.0 – 4.4 pg/mL 3.0 – 4.0 pg/mL Reverse T3 < 24 ng/dL < 15 ng/dL TPO Antibodies < 35 IU/mL < 10 IU/mL Thyroglobulin Antibodies < 40 IU/mL < 10 IU/mL 

Look at TSH. The standard range goes up to 4.5 mIU/L. A patient with a TSH of 4.2 will be told "your thyroid is normal." But research published in the *Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism *has shown that TSH levels above 2.5 are associated with increased risk of progression to overt hypothyroidism, and that patients with TSH in the 0.5-2.0 range report significantly better energy, mood, and cognitive function. The National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry has recommended narrowing the upper limit of the TSH reference range to 2.5 mIU/L — a recommendation that most labs and conventional practitioners still have not adopted. 

The same pattern holds for Free T3. A value of 2.3 pg/mL is technically "in range" but sits at the bottom — a level where most patients experience fatigue, brain fog, and difficulty with body composition. Moving that same patient to 3.2-3.8 pg/mL often resolves symptoms entirely. 

Reverse T3 is especially overlooked. A value of 20 ng/dL is "normal" by most lab ranges but indicates significant T3 receptor blockade. When the Reverse T3 to Free T3 ratio is too high, you have adequate thyroid hormone production that isn't getting into cells effectively. This is functional hypothyroidism that a standard panel will never detect. 

**The difference matters. **"Normal" means you don't have a disease that requires emergency intervention. "Optimal" means your thyroid is actually performing at the level that supports how you want to feel and function. These are not the same standard, and most people are being held to the wrong one. 
### COMMON THYROID DYSFUNCTION PATTERNS 

Thyroid dysfunction isn't one thing. It's a spectrum of patterns, each with a different root cause and requiring a different approach. Here are the most common patterns we identify and treat: 

Overt Hypothyroidism 

The classic pattern: TSH elevated above 4.5-10+ mIU/L, Free T4 and Free T3 below range. This is what standard medicine is built to catch. Symptoms are typically severe — significant fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation, depression. Treatment with thyroid hormone replacement is straightforward and universally accepted. This is the easy one. The problem is the patterns below, which are far more common and far more frequently missed. 

Subclinical Hypothyroidism 

TSH elevated (typically 2.5-10 mIU/L) with Free T4 still in range. Conventional medicine debates whether this needs treatment. The data is clear: subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with increased cardiovascular risk (Rodondi et al., 2010, JAMA), progression to overt hypothyroidism (Vanderpump et al., 1995), impaired cognitive function, and symptoms that reduce quality of life. A meta-analysis by Razvi et al. (2008) in the *Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism *showed that treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism improved lipid profiles, cardiac function, and symptom scores. Waiting for it to get worse is not a strategy. 

Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (Autoimmune Thyroiditis) 

The most common cause of hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient countries. Elevated TPO and/or Thyroglobulin antibodies indicate the immune system is attacking and gradually destroying thyroid tissue. The insidious part: TSH and thyroid hormones can remain "normal" for years while the gland is under active autoimmune attack. By the time TSH rises out of range, 50-80% of functional thyroid tissue may already be destroyed. Early detection through antibody testing allows intervention with lifestyle, nutrition, and immune-modulating strategies before irreversible gland loss. Hashimoto's affects up to 5% of the population and is 5-8 times more common in women. 

Poor T4-to-T3 Conversion 

TSH and Free T4 are normal, but Free T3 is low. The thyroid is producing adequate T4, but the body isn't converting it to the active T3 form efficiently. Conversion depends on the enzyme 5'-deiodinase, which requires selenium, zinc, and iron as cofactors, and is impaired by chronic stress (elevated cortisol), inflammation, gut dysfunction, caloric restriction, and certain medications. This pattern is extremely common in patients under chronic stress or those who have been aggressively dieting. Standard treatment with levothyroxine (T4 only) won't fix this — you're adding more of the hormone the body can't convert. These patients often need direct T3 supplementation or combination therapy. 

High Reverse T3 

Reverse T3 is elevated, effectively blocking T3 receptors even when Free T3 is adequate. Common triggers: chronic physiological or psychological stress, caloric restriction or prolonged fasting, systemic inflammation, chronic illness, and iron deficiency. The body is diverting T4 to the inactive pathway instead of the active one. This is a protective mechanism — the body is downregulating metabolism because it perceives a threat. The fix requires addressing the root cause (stress, inflammation, nutritional deficiency) in addition to potential medication adjustments. 

Thyroid + Sex Hormone Interactions 

Thyroid function doesn't exist in isolation. Estrogen increases thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), which binds more T4 and T3, reducing the amount of free (usable) hormone available. This is why women on oral estrogen (birth control pills, oral HRT) frequently develop thyroid symptoms — their total thyroid hormone may be adequate, but free hormone levels drop. Conversely, hypothyroidism increases SHBG and alters estrogen/progesterone ratios. Testosterone replacement can also affect thyroid-binding proteins. This is why hormone optimization requires looking at the entire endocrine system, not one axis at a time. 
### SYMPTOMS OF THYROID DYSFUNCTION 

Thyroid symptoms are non-specific — meaning they overlap with dozens of other conditions. This is part of why thyroid dysfunction is so often dismissed. But when multiple symptoms from this list cluster together, thyroid should be high on the differential. These are the most common presentations of hypothyroidism and suboptimal thyroid function: 

Fatigue & Low Energy 

Persistent tiredness that doesn't resolve with sleep. The hallmark symptom. Driven by reduced mitochondrial ATP production. 

Weight Gain 

Unexplained weight gain or inability to lose weight despite diet and exercise. Reduced metabolic rate plus increased water retention. 

Brain Fog 

Poor concentration, memory issues, slowed processing speed. T3 directly regulates cerebral blood flow and neurotransmitter synthesis. 

Cold Intolerance 

Always cold, cold hands and feet, needing extra layers. T3 drives thermogenesis. Low T3 means low heat production. 

Hair Thinning & Loss 

Diffuse hair thinning, loss of the outer third of the eyebrow, brittle hair. Thyroid hormones regulate the hair growth cycle directly. 

Dry Skin 

Rough, dry, flaky skin — especially on the shins, elbows, and hands. Reduced keratinocyte turnover and decreased sebum production. 

Constipation 

Slowed gut motility is a direct consequence of reduced T3 activity on smooth muscle. Often dismissed as a dietary issue when thyroid is the root cause. 

Depression & Mood Changes 

Low mood, irritability, anxiety, or frank depression. T3 modulates serotonin receptor sensitivity. Thyroid dysfunction should be ruled out before starting antidepressants. 

Elevated Cholesterol 

High LDL and total cholesterol that doesn't respond to diet. T3 upregulates hepatic LDL receptors. Fix the thyroid and cholesterol often normalizes without statins. 

Irregular Periods 

Heavy, irregular, or absent menstrual cycles. Thyroid dysfunction disrupts the HPG axis, alters SHBG, and impairs progesterone production. 

Muscle Weakness 

Generalized weakness, slow recovery from exercise, muscle cramps. T3 regulates muscle protein synthesis and mitochondrial density in skeletal muscle. 

Fluid Retention 

Puffy face, swollen hands or ankles. Hypothyroidism causes accumulation of hyaluronic acid in tissues, drawing water in. This is myxedema — distinct from normal edema. 

**The pattern matters more than any single symptom. **Fatigue alone could be a hundred things. Fatigue plus cold intolerance plus weight gain plus brain fog plus hair thinning — that clustering is thyroid until proven otherwise. And "proven otherwise" means a full panel, not just TSH. 
### HOW THYROID OPTIMIZATION WORKS AT MOONSHOT 

Thyroid optimization at Moonshot isn't a standalone protocol. It's part of a comprehensive approach to endocrine and metabolic health. The thyroid doesn't exist in isolation — it's regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis, influenced by cortisol (HPA axis), affected by sex hormones, and dependent on nutritional cofactors. We treat the system, not just the gland. 

1. Comprehensive Testing 

Full thyroid panel: TSH, Free T4, Free T3, Reverse T3, TPO antibodies, and Thyroglobulin antibodies. We also assess related markers: fasting insulin, inflammatory markers (hs-CRP, ferritin), iron studies (ferritin, serum iron, TIBC), vitamin D, selenium, zinc, and cortisol. These cofactors directly impact thyroid production, conversion, and receptor sensitivity. Without them, you're treating a symptom while the root cause persists. 

2. Clinical Interpretation in Context 

Numbers don't exist in a vacuum. A TSH of 1.5 in a 30-year-old with severe fatigue, weight gain, elevated TPO antibodies, and a Free T3 of 2.2 is not "fine." We interpret labs in the context of your symptoms, medical history, other hormone levels, body composition goals, and overall clinical picture. The question isn't "is this in range?" The question is "is this optimal for this patient?" 

3. Treatment Options 

Treatment is individualized based on the specific pattern of dysfunction. Options include: **Levothyroxine (synthetic T4) **— the standard first-line treatment; provides T4 that the body converts to T3. Works well for patients with intact conversion capacity. **Liothyronine (synthetic T3) **— direct T3 replacement, used when conversion is impaired or when patients don't respond adequately to T4 alone. Often added to levothyroxine as combination therapy. **Desiccated thyroid (Armour Thyroid, NP Thyroid) **— derived from porcine thyroid glands, contains both T4 and T3 in a physiologic ratio. Some patients prefer desiccated thyroid and report better symptom resolution compared to synthetic T4 alone. **Nutritional optimization **— correcting selenium, zinc, iron, iodine, and vitamin D deficiencies that impair thyroid function. **Lifestyle modification **— addressing chronic stress, sleep , gut health, and inflammatory triggers that suppress thyroid function. 

4. Ongoing Monitoring 

Thyroid optimization isn't "prescribe and forget." We recheck labs 6-8 weeks after initiation or dose changes (the time required for thyroid levels to reach steady state), then every 3-6 months once stable. Dosing is adjusted based on labs and symptoms — the goal is how you feel and function, not just where the numbers land. We also monitor for signs of over-replacement (resting heart rate, anxiety, bone density considerations) to ensure the dose stays in the therapeutic sweet spot. 

**Integration with hormone optimization: **Thyroid function affects and is affected by testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, cortisol, and insulin. Optimizing thyroid in isolation while ignoring a cortisol problem, an estrogen dominance pattern, or insulin resistance is incomplete medicine. At Moonshot, thyroid is one component of a full endocrine assessment. We address the entire system because that's how the body actually works. 
### COMMON QUESTIONS 
#### Why doesn't my doctor check more than just TSH? 

Most standard panels only test TSH, and sometimes Free T4. This is driven by insurance guidelines and a conventional model that treats thyroid disease as binary: you either have it or you don't. But this approach misses subclinical dysfunction, T4-to-T3 conversion issues, elevated reverse T3, and thyroid antibodies (Hashimoto's). A TSH-only approach is like checking your car's oil light but never testing the oil quality, filter condition, or engine temperature. Moonshot tests the full thyroid panel — TSH, Free T4, Free T3, Reverse T3, TPO antibodies, and Thyroglobulin antibodies — because you can't optimize what you don't measure. 
#### What's the difference between normal and optimal thyroid levels? 

Normal reference ranges are derived from population averages — which include sick, sedentary, and metabolically unhealthy people. They tell you whether you have a diagnosable disease, not whether your thyroid is performing well. Optimal ranges are narrower and based on where patients report feeling and performing their best. For example, a TSH of 4.0 mIU/L falls within the "normal" reference range (0.4-4.5), but most patients feel significantly better with a TSH under 2.0. The same pattern holds for Free T3, Free T4, and Reverse T3. Normal keeps you out of the emergency room. Optimal is where you actually feel good. 
#### Can thyroid problems cause weight gain? 

Yes. Hypothyroidism — even subclinical hypothyroidism — slows your basal metabolic rate, increases water retention, and impairs your body's ability to mobilize and burn fat. Overt hypothyroidism can cause 10 to 30 pounds of weight gain, and even mild thyroid underperformance (TSH in the 3-5 range) can make fat loss significantly harder despite consistent diet and exercise. This is one of the most frustrating patterns we see: patients doing everything right but unable to lose weight because their thyroid is technically "normal" but functionally sluggish. 
#### What does Moonshot's thyroid panel include? 

Our full thyroid panel includes: TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone), Free T4 (the inactive storage form), Free T3 (the active hormone your cells actually use), Reverse T3 (an inactive metabolite that blocks T3 receptors), TPO antibodies (thyroid peroxidase antibodies — the primary marker for Hashimoto's thyroiditis), and Thyroglobulin antibodies (another autoimmune marker). This gives us the complete picture: how much signal your brain is sending, how much hormone your thyroid is producing, how well you're converting it to the active form, whether it's being blocked, and whether your immune system is attacking the gland itself. A TSH-only test gives you one data point out of six. 
#### Is thyroid medication safe long-term? 

Yes. Thyroid hormone replacement — whether levothyroxine (synthetic T4), liothyronine (synthetic T3), or desiccated thyroid (Armour Thyroid, NP Thyroid) — is one of the most well-studied and commonly prescribed medication classes in medicine. It has been used safely for over 60 years. You are not adding a foreign substance to your body; you are replacing what your thyroid isn't producing enough of. The key is proper dosing and ongoing monitoring. Over-replacement can cause symptoms of hyperthyroidism (anxiety, rapid heart rate, bone loss), which is why regular lab work and clinical follow-up are essential. When dosed correctly and monitored properly, thyroid replacement is safe indefinitely.

Peptides & Performance 
## NAD+ & VITAMIN INJECTIONS 

What NAD+ is, why it matters at the cellular level, how injectable nutrients bypass the gut for direct delivery, and what the research actually shows about their effects on energy, recovery, and aging. 
### WHAT IS NAD+? 

NAD+ stands for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. It is a coenzyme found in every living cell in your body. Without it, you would be dead in about 30 seconds. That is not hyperbole. NAD+ is required for the most fundamental metabolic processes that keep cells alive and functioning. 

NAD+ exists in two forms: NAD+ (the oxidized form) and NADH (the reduced form). The ratio between these two forms drives some of the most critical biochemical reactions in your body. When NAD+ accepts electrons during metabolic reactions, it becomes NADH. When NADH donates those electrons (primarily in the mitochondrial electron transport chain), it becomes NAD+ again. This cycling is the engine of cellular energy production. 

But NAD+ is not just an energy molecule. It is a master regulator involved in at least five critical cellular functions: 
#### Mitochondrial Energy Production 

NAD+ is a required substrate in glycolysis, the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle), and the electron transport chain. These are the pathways that convert the food you eat into ATP, the energy currency of every cell. Without adequate NAD+, these pathways slow down. The result is reduced ATP output, which manifests as fatigue, poor exercise recovery, and diminished cellular function across every organ system. 
#### Sirtuin Activation (Longevity Genes) 

Sirtuins (SIRT1-7) are a family of enzymes that regulate gene expression, inflammation, stress resistance, and cellular repair. They are sometimes called "longevity genes" because their activation is associated with lifespan extension in animal models. Here is the critical point: sirtuins are NAD+-dependent enzymes. They literally cannot function without NAD+ as a co-substrate. When NAD+ levels drop, sirtuin activity drops with it. This is one of the proposed mechanisms linking NAD+ decline to accelerated aging. 
#### PARP-Mediated DNA Repair 

PARP enzymes (poly ADP-ribose polymerases) are the frontline repair crews for DNA damage. Every day, your cells sustain tens of thousands of DNA lesions from normal metabolic activity, UV exposure, oxidative stress, and environmental toxins. PARP enzymes detect and repair this damage. Like sirtuins, PARPs require NAD+ to function. When NAD+ is depleted, DNA repair capacity declines. Accumulated unrepaired DNA damage is a hallmark of aging and a driver of cancer risk. 
#### Circadian Rhythm Regulation 

NAD+ levels oscillate in a 24-hour cycle, and this oscillation is tightly linked to circadian clock gene expression. SIRT1 (NAD+-dependent) directly interacts with the core circadian machinery, including CLOCK and BMAL1. Declining NAD+ disrupts this interplay, contributing to the sleep disturbances , altered metabolism, and impaired recovery commonly seen with aging. It is a feedback loop: poor circadian function further impairs NAD+ synthesis, and low NAD+ further disrupts the clock. 
#### Neurotransmitter Synthesis & Immune Signaling 

NAD+ is involved in the synthesis of neurotransmitters and in immune cell signaling through CD38 and CD157 enzymes. CD38, in particular, is one of the largest consumers of NAD+ in the body, and its expression increases with age and chronic inflammation. This creates a vicious cycle: inflammation increases CD38 activity, which depletes NAD+, which impairs the cellular repair and immune regulation that would resolve the inflammation. 

**The age problem: **NAD+ levels decline significantly with age. Research estimates a roughly 50% decline by age 60. This decline correlates with reduced mitochondrial function, impaired DNA repair, decreased sirtuin activity, and the metabolic dysfunction that characterizes aging. The question driving current research: can restoring NAD+ levels slow or reverse these processes? 
### WHY INJECTABLE VS. ORAL 

The supplement industry sells billions of dollars of oral NAD+ precursors every year. NMN (nicotinamide mononucleotide) and NR (nicotinamide riboside) are the most popular. They are legitimate molecules with real science behind them. But there is a bioavailability problem that most marketing conveniently ignores. 

When you take oral NAD+ directly, most of it is broken down in the gastrointestinal tract before it ever reaches your bloodstream. The molecule is too large and too unstable to survive gastric acid and intestinal enzymes intact. Oral NMN and NR fare better because they are smaller precursor molecules that the body can convert into NAD+ after absorption. But even here, the conversion is multi-step and inefficient. You absorb a fraction of what you swallow, and then that fraction has to go through hepatic first-pass metabolism and enzymatic conversion before it becomes usable NAD+ in your cells. 

Injectable NAD+ bypasses all of this. The full dose enters the bloodstream directly, skipping the gastrointestinal tract, skipping first-pass liver metabolism, and delivering NAD+ to tissues at concentrations that oral supplementation simply cannot achieve. 

Oral NAD+ / NMN / NR 

Must survive stomach acid and intestinal enzymes. Absorbed through the gut lining (variable depending on gut health). Undergoes first-pass metabolism in the liver. Requires multi-step enzymatic conversion to become NAD+. Bioavailability estimates vary widely, but a significant portion of the ingested dose never reaches target tissues as NAD+. 

Injectable NAD+ 

Bypasses the entire GI tract. No first-pass metabolism. Full dose enters systemic circulation. Achieves plasma concentrations not possible with oral dosing. No dependency on gut health, intrinsic factor, or enzymatic conversion. 

B12: The Same Logic 

Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) oral absorption requires intrinsic factor, a protein produced by parietal cells in the stomach. Approximately 15% of the general population has some degree of intrinsic factor deficiency. Patients on metformin (common in diabetes and increasingly used off-label) have reduced B12 absorption. Patients with any GI dysfunction, inflammatory bowel conditions, or history of gastric surgery may absorb a fraction of oral B12. Injectable B12 bypasses all of these variables. 

**An important caveat: **Not everything needs to be injected. If you have normal gut function and adequate intrinsic factor, oral B12 supplementation works fine. If you eat a nutrient-dense diet, you may not need supplemental injections at all. Injectable delivery makes the most sense for nutrients where oral absorption is the documented bottleneck, or for patients with known absorption issues. This is targeted intervention, not a blanket replacement for oral supplementation. 
### WHAT WE OFFER 

At Moonshot Medical, injectable nutrient therapy is part of a broader optimization approach. These are not standalone "wellness shots" sold at a juice bar. They are clinical tools used alongside lab work, hormone optimization, and performance programming to address specific deficiencies and support defined physiological goals. 
#### NAD+ Injections 

**What it targets: **Cellular energy production, mitochondrial function, DNA repair, sirtuin-mediated gene regulation, and the metabolic decline associated with aging. 

**Who it is for: **Patients experiencing age-related energy decline, athletes looking to optimize recovery and mitochondrial output, patients on hormone therapy who want to support the metabolic pathways those hormones activate, and anyone with documented markers of NAD+ insufficiency or accelerated biological aging. 

**How it is administered: **Subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion, depending on dose and protocol. Subcutaneous is faster (approximately 5 minutes) with lower peak plasma concentrations. IV allows higher doses and sustained delivery over 30-60 minutes. 
#### B12 Injections (Methylcobalamin / Cyanocobalamin) 

**What it targets: **Energy metabolism, red blood cell production, nervous system function, methylation pathways, and homocysteine regulation. 

**Who it is for: **Patients with documented B12 deficiency (more common than most people realize), patients on metformin, patients with GI absorption issues, vegetarians/vegans (B12 is found almost exclusively in animal products), and patients with elevated homocysteine levels. 

**Why inject: **B12 deficiency is often a function of absorption, not intake. You can eat adequate B12 and still be deficient if intrinsic factor or gut absorption is compromised. Injectable B12 is the standard medical treatment for documented deficiency, not an alternative therapy. 

**Included with hormone optimization: **Moonshot Medical hormone optimization members receive 1 vitamin injection per month included in their membership. This is designed to complement the metabolic support that hormone therapy provides. NAD+ in particular supports the same mitochondrial and cellular repair pathways that optimized hormone levels activate. 
### WHAT THE EVIDENCE SAYS 

Honesty matters here. NAD+ science is one of the most active areas of aging research, with legitimate, well-funded labs producing real data. But the field is at different stages of maturity depending on what you are looking at. Here is a straightforward assessment of where the evidence stands. 

Strong: NAD+ Decline With Age 

This is well-established. Multiple studies have documented the age-related decline of NAD+ in human tissues. Massudi et al. (2012) demonstrated declining NAD+ levels in human skin tissue with age. Camacho-Pereira et al. (2016) identified CD38 as a primary driver of age-related NAD+ depletion. Zhu et al. (2015) confirmed the relationship between NAD+ decline and mitochondrial dysfunction. The "what" is not in question. NAD+ goes down as you get older, and this decline correlates with impaired cellular function. 

Strong: Animal Models of NAD+ Restoration 

Animal data is robust. Rajman, Chwalek, and Sinclair (2018) published a comprehensive review in *Cell Metabolism *documenting how NAD+ boosting in mice reverses mitochondrial dysfunction, improves metabolic function, extends lifespan, and protects against neurodegeneration. Yoshino et al. (2011, 2018) demonstrated that NMN supplementation in mice reverses age-associated metabolic decline, improves insulin sensitivity, and restores mitochondrial function. Mills et al. (2016) showed long-term NMN administration mitigated age-associated physiological decline in mice without toxicity. 

Emerging: Human Clinical Trials 

This is where you need to be realistic. Human clinical trial data is accumulating but not yet definitive for many of the claimed benefits. Yoshino et al. (2021) published a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in *Science *showing that NMN supplementation increased NAD+ metabolites and improved muscle insulin sensitivity in prediabetic postmenopausal women. Liao et al. (2021) demonstrated that NR supplementation safely elevated NAD+ levels in middle-aged and older adults. Several Phase I and Phase II trials are ongoing for NAD+ precursors in aging, neurodegeneration, and metabolic disease. The safety profile is favorable. The efficacy data for specific clinical endpoints is still being built. 

Established: B12 Injection Therapy 

B12 injection evidence is on different footing entirely. Injectable B12 is the standard of care for pernicious anemia and documented B12 deficiency. This is not emerging science. It is established medical practice backed by decades of clinical evidence. The only question is whether patients without documented deficiency benefit from supraphysiologic B12 levels, and there the evidence is less clear. 

**The bottom line: **The cellular biology of NAD+ is well-understood. The age-related decline is documented. The animal data is compelling. The human clinical data is promising and growing but not yet at the level of large-scale, long-term randomized controlled trials for all endpoints. We believe the mechanistic rationale is strong enough to offer NAD+ therapy to appropriate patients, while being transparent that the field is still maturing. This is not "proven to reverse aging." It is a biologically plausible intervention with a favorable safety profile and accumulating evidence. That is an honest framing. 
### WHO SHOULD CONSIDER NAD+ INJECTIONS 

NAD+ therapy is not for everyone. It is most relevant for patients whose symptoms, age, or clinical context suggest that declining NAD+ levels may be contributing to their complaints. Here are the profiles that benefit most: 
#### Chronic Fatigue 

Persistent fatigue that does not resolve with sleep, nutrition, and basic bloodwork optimization. If mitochondrial output is the bottleneck, NAD+ addresses the substrate deficiency directly. 
#### Athletes & Active Individuals 

Athletes with high training volumes place enormous demands on mitochondrial function and cellular repair. NAD+ supports the energy systems and recovery pathways that high-output training requires. 
#### Age 40+ 

The age-related decline in NAD+ is measurable and progressive. Patients over 40 are in the window where NAD+ levels have dropped enough to potentially affect mitochondrial function, DNA repair capacity, and sirtuin activity. 
#### Patients on Hormone Therapy 

Optimized testosterone, thyroid , or peptide therapy activates metabolic pathways that require NAD+ as a co-substrate. Think of NAD+ as the fuel for the engine that hormones are tuning. Without adequate NAD+, hormone optimization may not reach its full potential. 
#### Brain Fog & Cognitive Decline 

The brain is one of the most metabolically demanding organs, consuming roughly 20% of the body's energy. NAD+ depletion in neural tissue is implicated in cognitive decline, and preclinical research shows NAD+ restoration improves neuronal function in animal models. 
#### Post-Illness Recovery 

Acute illness and systemic inflammation consume NAD+ at accelerated rates (via PARP and CD38 activation). Patients recovering from significant illness may have depleted NAD+ reserves that are slow to rebuild through diet alone. 
### WHAT TO EXPECT 

If you have never had an NAD+ injection, knowing what to expect removes the uncertainty. Here is an honest breakdown of the experience. 
#### Administration Methods 

**Subcutaneous injection: **A small injection just under the skin, typically in the abdomen or upper arm. Takes about 5 minutes. Lower peak plasma concentrations than IV, but faster and more convenient. Most patients tolerate this well with minimal side effects. 

**Intravenous (IV) infusion: **Delivered directly into the vein via a slow drip. Takes 30 to 60 minutes depending on the dose. Allows higher doses and produces higher peak plasma concentrations. More likely to cause the transient flushing and warmth that are characteristic of NAD+ delivery. The infusion rate is adjusted based on patient tolerance. 
#### During the Injection 

**What you may feel: **NAD+ infusions commonly produce a sensation of warmth, flushing (especially in the chest and face), and sometimes mild nausea or a feeling of chest tightness. This is a direct pharmacological effect of NAD+ entering the bloodstream rapidly. It is not dangerous. It is temporary, resolving within minutes of slowing or completing the infusion. 

**Managing it: **Slowing the infusion rate is the primary way to reduce these sensations. An experienced provider adjusts the rate to keep you comfortable. Subcutaneous injections produce less of this effect because the absorption is more gradual. 
#### After the Injection 

**Immediate: **Any flushing or warmth resolves within minutes. Most patients feel normal or slightly energized. Some report a sense of mental clarity shortly after. 

**Over days and weeks: **NAD+ therapy is not a single-dose treatment. The effects are cumulative. Many patients report noticeable improvements in energy, mental clarity, and exercise recovery within 1 to 2 weeks of regular injections. A typical loading protocol is 1 to 2 injections per week for 2 to 4 weeks, followed by weekly or biweekly maintenance. 

**What it is not: **NAD+ is not a stimulant. You will not feel "wired" or experience a crash. The energy improvements are metabolic, not adrenal. They come from improved mitochondrial output, not from cortisol or catecholamine release. 

**B12 injections are simpler: **A quick intramuscular injection, typically in the deltoid. Takes 30 seconds. Minimal side effects beyond occasional soreness at the injection site. Effects on energy are usually noticed within a few days, especially in patients who were deficient. 
### COMMON QUESTIONS 
#### What does NAD+ actually do? 

NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) is a coenzyme in every living cell. It is essential for energy production (mitochondrial function), DNA repair, gene expression regulation (sirtuins), and cellular signaling. Levels decline 50%+ by age 60. Low NAD+ means impaired energy, slower recovery, and accelerated aging at the cellular level. 
#### Why inject instead of taking a pill? 

Oral NAD+ supplements have very poor bioavailability. Most is broken down in the gut before reaching cells. Injectable NAD+ bypasses digestion entirely, delivering the full dose directly to the bloodstream. The same logic applies to B12: oral absorption depends on intrinsic factor and gut health, which many people have issues with. Injectable delivery solves the absorption bottleneck. 
#### Who benefits most from NAD+ injections? 

People experiencing fatigue, slow recovery from exercise, brain fog, or signs of accelerated aging. Athletes looking to optimize recovery. Patients on hormone therapy, since NAD+ supports the metabolic pathways that hormones activate. Anyone over 40 with declining energy that is not explained by other factors. 
#### How often should I get NAD+ injections? 

Typical protocol is 1-2x per week during an initial loading phase (2-4 weeks), then 1x weekly or biweekly for maintenance. Some patients transition to monthly maintenance once they have reached their goals. At Moonshot, hormone optimization members get 1 vitamin injection per month included in their membership. 
#### Are there side effects? 

NAD+ injections can cause flushing, warmth, mild nausea, or chest tightness during the injection. This is temporary and resolves within minutes. Slowing the injection rate reduces these effects significantly. B12 injections have minimal side effects beyond occasional soreness at the injection site. Both have favorable safety profiles when administered by trained providers.

### Dry Needling: What It Is, How It Works & What to Expect

Rehab & Recovery 
## DRY NEEDLING 

What it is, how it works at the neuromuscular level, what conditions it treats, and what to expect when a thin monofilament needle resets a dysfunctional trigger point. 
### WHAT IS DRY NEEDLING? 

Dry needling is a technique in which a thin, solid, monofilament needle is inserted directly into myofascial trigger points — hyperirritable spots within a taut band of skeletal muscle. The needle is "dry" because nothing is injected. There's no medication, no saline, no anesthetic. The needle itself is the treatment. 

These needles are extremely thin — typically 0.16 to 0.30 mm in diameter — and solid, not hollow like a hypodermic needle used for injections or blood draws. The filiform needles are the same type used in acupuncture, but that's where the similarity ends. Dry needling is rooted in modern Western neuroscience and musculoskeletal anatomy, not Traditional Chinese Medicine. 

The goal is specific: locate the dysfunctional trigger point, insert the needle, elicit a local twitch response, and reset the neuromuscular environment of that tissue. When it works — and there is a growing body of evidence that it does — the result is reduced pain, restored range of motion, and improved muscle function, often within a single session. 

**Key distinction: **Dry needling is not acupuncture. It uses similar needles, but the theoretical framework, point selection, treatment goals, and clinical training are entirely different. Dry needling targets identifiable musculoskeletal dysfunction. Acupuncture is based on Traditional Chinese Medicine meridian theory and energy flow. 
### HOW DRY NEEDLING WORKS 

A myofascial trigger point is not just a "knot." It's a localized area of muscle where the motor endplate is dysfunctional — stuck in a state of sustained contraction. The sarcomeres (the contractile units of muscle fibers) in the trigger point are maximally shortened, creating a palpable taut band. This contraction compresses local blood vessels, reducing oxygen delivery and waste removal, which creates a self-perpetuating cycle of dysfunction and pain. 

When the needle enters this tissue, several things happen in sequence: 

1. Local Twitch Response (LTR) 

The needle mechanically disrupts the taut band, triggering an involuntary, rapid contraction of the muscle fibers — the local twitch response. This is both diagnostic and therapeutic. The LTR confirms you've hit the trigger point, and the contraction itself begins the process of releasing the sustained shortening. Research by Simons and Hong demonstrated that eliciting the LTR is a key predictor of treatment success. 

2. Chemical Environment Reset 

The biochemical milieu of a trigger point is measurably different from normal tissue. Shah et al. (2008) demonstrated that active trigger points contain elevated concentrations of substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), bradykinin, serotonin, norepinephrine, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Acetylcholine levels at the dysfunctional motor endplate are abnormally high, maintaining the sustained contraction. The needle disrupts this chemical environment, normalizing the concentrations of these nociceptive and inflammatory mediators. 

3. Increased Local Blood Flow 

The sustained contraction in a trigger point compresses capillaries, creating local ischemia (reduced blood flow). The twitch response and subsequent relaxation of the taut band restores blood flow to the area, bringing oxygen and nutrients while flushing accumulated metabolic waste products — the same substances that were sensitizing local nociceptors and perpetuating the pain cycle. 

4. Endogenous Analgesic Response 

Needle insertion activates A-delta and C nerve fibers, which triggers a cascade of endogenous pain-modulating mechanisms. This includes segmental inhibition (gate control theory — the needle stimulus "closes the gate" to pain signals at the spinal cord level), activation of the descending inhibitory pain pathway from the periaqueductal gray matter, and release of endogenous opioids including enkephalins and beta-endorphins. The result is both local and systemic pain reduction. 

5. Neuromuscular Reset 

By disrupting the dysfunctional motor endplate and normalizing the chemical environment, dry needling effectively resets the neuromuscular feedback loop. The muscle can return to its normal resting length and normal contractile function. This is why patients often notice an immediate improvement in range of motion — the mechanical restriction has been released at the tissue level. 

6. Localized Healing Cascade 

The micro-trauma from needle insertion initiates a controlled inflammatory and healing response. The body sends platelets, growth factors, and fibroblasts to the needle site. This is similar to the concept behind other micro-trauma therapies (like microneedling for skin or shockwave therapy for tendons) — a small, controlled injury that stimulates the body's own repair mechanisms to address tissue that was stuck in a dysfunctional state. 
### HOW DRY NEEDLING IS PERFORMED 

Dry needling is a hands-on, clinician-driven procedure. There's no machine doing the work. The practitioner's skill in palpation, anatomy knowledge, and needling technique determines the outcome. Here's what the process looks like: 
#### Assessment & Positioning 

The session begins with a focused assessment. The clinician identifies the involved muscles based on your symptoms, movement patterns, and pain distribution. You'll be positioned to allow access to the target muscles while keeping you comfortable — this varies depending on the area being treated. For upper trapezius work, you might be seated or prone. For piriformis, you'll likely be side-lying. 
#### Palpation & Trigger Point Identification 

This is the most important step. The clinician uses flat palpation or pincer palpation to locate the taut band within the muscle, then identifies the most hyperirritable point within that band — the trigger point. A skilled practitioner can feel the difference between normal tissue, a taut band, and an active trigger point. The palpation itself often reproduces the patient's familiar pain pattern, confirming the correct target. 
#### Needle Insertion & Technique 

The clinician uses a guide tube or direct insertion to advance the needle through the skin and into the trigger point. Two primary techniques are used: 

**Pistoning: **The needle is repeatedly advanced and partially withdrawn in a rapid in-and-out motion within the trigger point. This technique is designed to elicit multiple local twitch responses and thoroughly disrupt the dysfunctional tissue. It's the most common technique for deep trigger points. 

**Fanning: **After initial insertion, the needle is redirected at different angles without being fully withdrawn, "fanning" through the trigger point zone. This covers a broader area of the taut band and is often used when the trigger point is diffuse or when multiple closely spaced points are present. 

Needle depth varies significantly depending on the muscle group. Superficial muscles like the upper trapezius or temporalis may require only 10-15 mm of depth. Deep muscles like the gluteus medius, piriformis, or multifidus may require 40-60 mm or more. The clinician's anatomical knowledge is critical — knowing what structures lie beneath the needle path at every depth. 
#### Session Parameters 

A typical session lasts 15 to 30 minutes. The number of trigger points treated in a single session depends on the patient's tolerance, the severity of the condition, and whether it's a first session or a follow-up. First sessions are typically more conservative — treating 4 to 8 points — to gauge the patient's response and soreness levels. Experienced patients and follow-up sessions may address more points. 

The clinician monitors for the local twitch response throughout. Once the twitching in a trigger point diminishes or stops (meaning the taut band has released), the needle is removed from that point and the practitioner moves to the next target. 
### CONDITIONS TREATED WITH DRY NEEDLING 

Dry needling is used for any condition involving myofascial trigger points, muscle tension, or neuromuscular dysfunction. That covers a wide range of musculoskeletal complaints — far more than most people realize. 
#### Chronic Myofascial Pain 

The primary indication. Myofascial pain syndrome — persistent pain and dysfunction caused by trigger points — is one of the most common and underdiagnosed sources of musculoskeletal pain. Dry needling directly addresses the pathology. 
#### Tension & Cervicogenic Headaches 

Trigger points in the upper trapezius, suboccipital muscles, sternocleidomastoid, and temporalis are well-documented sources of referred headache pain. Dry needling these muscles can reduce headache frequency and intensity, often when other treatments have failed. 
#### Neck & Shoulder Pain 

Upper trapezius, levator scapulae, scalenes, infraspinatus, and supraspinatus are among the most commonly needled muscles. These areas are heavily affected by postural stress, desk work, and overhead movements. 
#### Low Back Pain 

Trigger points in the quadratus lumborum, multifidus, gluteus medius, and piriformis are common contributors to low back pain that is often misattributed solely to disc pathology. Dry needling these deep muscles can provide relief when stretching and foam rolling can't reach the problem. 
#### Tennis & Golfer's Elbow 

Lateral epicondylalgia (tennis elbow) and medial epicondylalgia (golfer's elbow) often involve trigger points in the forearm extensors and flexors. Dry needling the involved muscles — particularly the extensor carpi radialis brevis and common extensor origin — can address the myofascial component that perpetuates these conditions. 
#### TMJ & Jaw Pain 

Trigger points in the masseter, temporalis, and lateral pterygoid muscles are major contributors to temporomandibular joint dysfunction, jaw clenching, and associated facial pain. Dry needling these muscles requires precision due to the area's anatomy but can be highly effective. 
#### Plantar Fasciitis 

Trigger points in the gastrocnemius, soleus, and intrinsic foot muscles contribute to plantar heel pain. Dry needling the calf musculature and the plantar fascia itself (using a specific technique) has shown effectiveness in cases resistant to conventional treatment. 
#### Rotator Cuff Dysfunction 

Infraspinatus, supraspinatus, subscapularis, and teres minor trigger points can mimic or exacerbate rotator cuff pathology. Dry needling is used both as a treatment and as a diagnostic tool — if needling the trigger point resolves the pain pattern, the myofascial component is confirmed. 
#### IT Band Syndrome 

Trigger points in the tensor fasciae latae, vastus lateralis, and gluteus maximus contribute to lateral knee pain often attributed to IT band syndrome. Dry needling addresses the muscular drivers rather than just the symptomatic tissue. 
#### Post-Surgical Scar Tissue 

Scar tissue and adhesions from surgery can create trigger points and restrict normal movement patterns. Dry needling around and through scar tissue helps remodel collagen fibers, reduce adhesions, and restore mobility in the surrounding musculature. 
### WHAT THE EVIDENCE SAYS 

Dry needling has a substantial and growing evidence base. Unlike many manual therapy techniques that rely primarily on clinical experience, dry needling has been evaluated in systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials across multiple conditions. Here's what the research shows: 
#### Systematic Reviews & Meta-Analyses 

A 2013 systematic review by Cagnie et al. in *Physical Therapy *examined the evidence for dry needling in the management of myofascial trigger points in the upper quarter (neck, shoulder, and upper back). The review found consistent evidence that dry needling reduces pain and improves function in these regions. 

Espejo-Antunez et al. (2017) conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis in the *Journal of Pain Research *evaluating dry needling for tension-type headaches. The analysis found significant reductions in headache frequency, intensity, and duration compared to sham needling and control groups. 

A Cochrane-style systematic review by Gattie et al. (2017) published in the *Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy *evaluated dry needling for musculoskeletal conditions and concluded that dry needling is more effective than sham or placebo for pain reduction in the short and medium term, with moderate-quality evidence supporting its use. 
#### Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) 

**Neck pain: **Liu et al. (2015) published an RCT in *Medicine *comparing dry needling to sham needling in patients with chronic neck pain. The dry needling group showed statistically significant improvements in pain (VAS) and disability (NDI) scores at both short-term and 3-month follow-up. 

**Low back pain: **Koppenhaver et al. (2015) published an RCT in the *Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy *showing that dry needling of the multifidus muscle in patients with low back pain produced immediate improvements in muscle thickness (measured by ultrasound), reduced disability, and decreased pain. The multifidus is a deep spinal stabilizer that is extremely difficult to target with manual therapy alone. 

**Lateral epicondylalgia: **Uygur et al. (2017) compared dry needling to corticosteroid injection for lateral epicondylalgia. Both groups showed improvement, but the dry needling group demonstrated more sustained long-term outcomes without the tissue degradation risks associated with repeated steroid injections. 

**Plantar heel pain: **Cotchett et al. (2014) conducted a sham-controlled RCT published in the *British Journal of Sports Medicine *demonstrating that dry needling of the plantar fascia and calf muscles produced significant pain reduction compared to sham needling at 6-week follow-up. 
#### Mechanistic Research 

The most foundational mechanistic work comes from Shah et al. (2005, 2008) at the National Institutes of Health. Using microdialysis needles inserted into active trigger points, they measured the biochemical environment before and after dry needling. They demonstrated that active trigger points contain significantly elevated levels of inflammatory and nociceptive chemicals — and that eliciting a local twitch response normalizes these concentrations toward baseline. This was the first direct biochemical evidence explaining why dry needling works. 

Hong (1994) established that obtaining a local twitch response during needling is critical for therapeutic effect. Patients in whom a twitch response was elicited had significantly better outcomes than those in whom it was not. 

**The bottom line: **Dry needling is not a fringe technique with anecdotal support. It has systematic reviews, RCTs, and mechanistic research supporting its use for myofascial pain, headaches, neck pain, low back pain, and extremity conditions. The evidence is strongest for pain reduction and improved range of motion in the short to medium term, especially when combined with exercise and manual therapy. 
### DRY NEEDLING VS. ACUPUNCTURE 

This is the most common question. They look similar — both use thin filiform needles. But they are fundamentally different approaches based on entirely different frameworks. 
#### Dry Needling 

**Theoretical framework: **Modern Western neuroscience, musculoskeletal anatomy, and neurophysiology. 

**Point selection: **Based on palpation of myofascial trigger points — identifiable, reproducible, anatomically defined points of muscle dysfunction. 

**Goal: **Elicit a local twitch response, release the taut band, normalize the neurochemical environment, and restore normal muscle function. 

**Training: **Postgraduate training for licensed healthcare providers (physical therapists, chiropractors, MDs) with focus on anatomy, trigger point identification, and safe needling technique. 

**Diagnosis model: **Based on musculoskeletal assessment, movement analysis, and pain science. 
#### Acupuncture 

**Theoretical framework: **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), based on the concept of qi (energy) flowing through meridians (channels) in the body. 

**Point selection: **Based on TCM meridian theory — predetermined points along energy channels selected to influence the flow of qi and restore energetic balance. 

**Goal: **Restore the flow and balance of qi throughout the body's meridian system to treat disease and dysfunction. 

**Training: **Master's degree in acupuncture or Traditional Chinese Medicine (typically 3-4 years), with focus on TCM theory, meridian systems, and holistic diagnosis. 

**Diagnosis model: **Based on TCM assessment including tongue and pulse diagnosis, pattern identification, and energetic imbalance. 

**Neither is "better" in an absolute sense **— they're different tools with different paradigms. But if your problem is a palpable trigger point in your upper trapezius that's causing headaches and restricting your neck range of motion, dry needling targets that specific pathology directly. The needle goes into the dysfunctional tissue because the tissue is dysfunctional — not because it sits on a meridian line. 
### WHAT TO EXPECT DURING AND AFTER 

Knowing what to expect removes uncertainty and makes the experience significantly better. Here's an honest breakdown: 
#### During the Session 

**Needle insertion: **The needle passing through the skin is often barely felt — many patients say they didn't know the needle was in until the twitch response happens. The filiform needle is thin enough that the insertion is less painful than a standard blood draw or injection. 

**The twitch response: **This is what you'll feel. When the needle hits the trigger point, the muscle will visibly and involuntarily contract — a quick, localized twitch or jump. It feels like a brief deep cramp or a flick inside the muscle. It lasts a fraction of a second but can be startling the first time. Some patients describe it as uncomfortable but not painful; others feel a deep aching or cramping sensation that resolves within seconds. 

**Multiple points: **The clinician will typically treat several trigger points in a session, moving between muscles based on your presentation. Some twitches will be stronger than others depending on the irritability of the trigger point. 

**Immediate effects: **Many patients notice increased range of motion and reduced pain immediately after the needles are removed. You may feel a sense of heaviness or relaxation in the treated area — the muscle has just released a sustained contraction it may have been holding for weeks or months. 
#### After the Session 

**Soreness (24-48 hours): **Post-treatment soreness is normal and expected. It feels like the deep soreness you get after a hard workout — not sharp pain, but a dull ache in the treated muscles. This is the result of the micro-trauma and local inflammatory response that's part of the healing process. It typically resolves within 24 to 48 hours. 

**Bruising: **Some bruising is possible, particularly in areas with more superficial blood vessels or in patients who bruise easily. Minor bruising is cosmetic and resolves on its own within a few days. 

**Fatigue: **Some patients feel a general sense of fatigue or relaxation after treatment, especially after the first session. This is a normal systemic response to the neurophysiological changes triggered by the treatment. 

**Improved range of motion: **Increased range of motion and reduced pain are often noticeable the same day. Full therapeutic benefit typically builds over 2-3 sessions as the treated muscles maintain their restored length and the neuromuscular system recalibrates. 

**Post-treatment recommendations: **Stay hydrated, move gently through the day (don't immobilize the treated area), and apply heat rather than ice if the area feels sore. Avoid intense exercise targeting the treated muscles for 24 hours. The goal is to let the muscle settle into its new, restored resting state. 
### COMMON QUESTIONS 
#### Is dry needling painful? 

Most patients describe the needle insertion itself as barely noticeable — the needles are extremely thin (0.16-0.30 mm), much thinner than a hypodermic needle. What you will feel is the local twitch response: a brief, involuntary muscle contraction that can feel like a deep cramp or a flick inside the muscle. It lasts a fraction of a second. Some people find the twitch uncomfortable but tolerable; others barely notice it. Soreness similar to a deep workout is common for 24-48 hours afterward. 
#### How many sessions will I need? 

It depends on the condition, how long it's been present, and how your body responds. Acute issues may resolve in 2-4 sessions. Chronic conditions like long-standing myofascial pain or tension headaches often require 4-8 sessions over several weeks, sometimes with periodic maintenance. Many patients notice improvement after the first or second session — especially in range of motion and pain reduction. 
#### Who is qualified to perform dry needling? 

Licensing varies by state. In most states, dry needling can be performed by physical therapists, chiropractors, and medical doctors who have completed specific postgraduate training in the technique. Training typically involves coursework in musculoskeletal anatomy, trigger point identification, needling technique, and safety protocols, plus supervised clinical hours. Always verify that your provider has completed accredited dry needling training. 
#### Can dry needling be combined with other treatments? 

Yes — and it often works best that way. Dry needling is frequently combined with manual therapy, corrective exercise, chiropractic adjustments, and rehabilitation protocols. The needling resets the dysfunctional tissue, and the complementary treatments reinforce proper movement patterns and address underlying biomechanical issues. At Moonshot, dry needling is part of an integrated rehab and recovery approach, not a standalone treatment. 
#### Is dry needling covered by insurance? 

Coverage varies by insurance plan and state. Some insurance plans cover dry needling when performed by a licensed provider (such as a physical therapist or chiropractor) as part of a treatment plan for a diagnosed condition. Others do not. It is increasingly recognized, but coverage is not universal. Check with your insurance provider for specifics. At Moonshot, we can help you understand your options. 
#### Are there any contraindications? 

Yes. Dry needling is generally not performed on patients with bleeding disorders or who are on anticoagulant therapy (without medical clearance), patients with needle phobia that would prevent tolerating the procedure, areas with active skin infection or open wounds, patients who are immunocompromised (relative contraindication), or directly over implants or prostheses. Pregnancy is a relative contraindication for certain areas. Your provider will screen for these before treatment.

### DEALING WITH CHRONIC PAIN OR TENSION? 

Dry needling targets the source of myofascial pain at the tissue level. If stretching, foam rolling, and massage aren't getting the job done, this might be the missing piece.

### Shockwave Therapy (ESWT): How It Works, What It Treats & What to Expect
URL: https://moonshotmp.com/learn/shockwave-therapy/

Rehab & Recovery 
## SHOCKWAVE THERAPY 

A non-invasive acoustic wave treatment that triggers your body's own healing response. Backed by decades of research for chronic tendon injuries that won't resolve on their own. 
### WHAT IS SHOCKWAVE THERAPY? 

Extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) is a non-invasive treatment that delivers acoustic pressure waves through the skin into injured tissue. "Extracorporeal" simply means "outside the body"--the energy is generated externally and transmitted into the tissue without breaking the skin. 

The technology was originally developed in the 1980s for lithotripsy--breaking up kidney stones without surgery. Urologists noticed something unexpected: patients who received shockwave treatment showed accelerated bone healing near the treatment site. This observation launched decades of research into shockwave therapy for musculoskeletal conditions, and the results have been remarkably consistent. 

Today, shockwave therapy is one of the most evidence-backed non-invasive treatments available for chronic tendon injuries, plantar fasciitis, calcific tendinopathy, and a growing list of musculoskeletal conditions. 
#### Focused Shockwave (fESWT) 

Produces a single, high-energy acoustic wave that converges at a specific depth in the tissue. The energy is concentrated at a precise focal point, making it ideal for deep structures and specific lesions like calcific deposits. Generated electromagnetically, electrohydraulically, or piezoelectrically. Higher peak pressure, deeper penetration (up to 12 cm), and more targeted--but also more intense, sometimes requiring local anesthesia. 
#### Radial Pressure Wave (rPWT / rESWT) 

Generated by a pneumatically driven projectile that strikes an applicator tip. The pressure wave radiates outward from the contact point, dispersing energy across a broader area. Lower peak pressure, shallower penetration (up to 3-4 cm), and covers a wider treatment zone. Better tolerated without anesthesia and effective for superficial tendons, trigger points , and larger areas of pathology. This is the most commonly used form in clinical practice. 

**Key distinction: **Both types deliver mechanical energy to tissue and trigger biological healing responses. Focused shockwave is more precise and penetrates deeper. Radial shockwave covers a broader area and is more comfortable. Many clinics use radial shockwave as the primary modality, with focused shockwave reserved for deeper or more targeted applications. 
### HOW SHOCKWAVE THERAPY WORKS 

Chronic tendon injuries don't heal on their own because they get stuck. The initial inflammatory phase that's supposed to kick off repair either never fully activates or stalls out. Blood supply to tendons is already limited, and chronic overuse creates a degenerative cycle--the tissue breaks down faster than it rebuilds. This is why rest alone rarely fixes a chronic tendinopathy. You're not dealing with acute inflammation anymore; you're dealing with failed healing. 

Shockwave therapy works by deliberately restarting that stalled healing process. The acoustic waves create controlled mechanical stress at the cellular level--a process called mechanotransduction--which triggers a cascade of biological responses. 

Neovascularization (New Blood Vessel Formation) 

Shockwave upregulates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), which stimulate the formation of new blood vessels in the treated area. This is critical--chronic tendinopathies are characterized by poor blood supply, and you can't heal tissue you can't deliver nutrients to. Published studies show significant increases in blood flow to treated tendons within weeks. 

Growth Factor Release 

The mechanical stress triggers release of multiple growth factors: VEGF for blood vessel formation, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) for tissue regeneration, transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-B1) for collagen production, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) for cell proliferation. These are the same signals your body uses in acute healing--shockwave re-activates them in tissue that's stopped responding. 

Collagen Synthesis Stimulation 

Shockwave therapy stimulates fibroblast activity and promotes the production of type I collagen--the structural protein that gives tendons their strength. In chronic tendinopathy, the normal collagen architecture becomes disorganized. Shockwave triggers a remodeling process where disordered collagen is gradually replaced with properly aligned fibers, restoring tensile strength to the tendon. 

Calcific Deposit Breakdown 

In calcific tendinopathy (especially the rotator cuff), calcium deposits accumulate within the tendon and cause significant pain and restricted motion. Shockwave therapy mechanically fragments these deposits while simultaneously triggering macrophage activity to reabsorb the calcium. This is one of the strongest indications for shockwave--studies show over 80% calcium resorption rates. 

Substance P Depletion (Pain Reduction) 

Substance P is a neurotransmitter that mediates pain signaling. Shockwave therapy causes an initial release of substance P followed by depletion--effectively reducing pain signal transmission in the treated area. This is why many patients experience pain relief that develops progressively over weeks. The analgesic effect compounds as healing progresses. 

Stem Cell Activation and Migration 

Research has shown that shockwave therapy activates mesenchymal stem cells and promotes their migration to the treatment site. These cells can differentiate into tenocytes (tendon cells), osteoblasts (bone cells), and other cell types needed for tissue repair. This mechanism is particularly relevant for non-union fractures and tendon-bone junction injuries. 

Osteoblast and Fibroblast Stimulation 

The mechanical energy directly stimulates osteoblasts (bone-building cells) and fibroblasts (connective tissue cells) to increase their metabolic activity. This is the mechanotransduction pathway at work: cells convert mechanical signals into biochemical responses, upregulating repair processes that had stalled in the chronic injury state. 
### WHAT A TREATMENT SESSION LOOKS LIKE 

Shockwave therapy is an in-clinic procedure that requires no preparation, no anesthesia (for radial shockwave), and no downtime. Here's what to expect step by step. 01 
#### Assessment and Positioning 

Your provider locates the exact area of pathology through palpation and your pain response. The treatment area is identified and you're positioned comfortably. The affected tendon or structure is placed under slight tension when possible--this improves wave transmission and treatment effectiveness. 02 
#### Coupling Gel Applied 

A water-based coupling gel (similar to ultrasound gel) is applied to the skin over the treatment area. This eliminates air between the applicator and your skin, allowing efficient transmission of acoustic waves into the tissue. Without it, the waves would reflect off the skin surface. 03 
#### Treatment Delivery 

The handheld applicator is positioned over the treatment area and activated. You'll feel a rapid tapping or pulsing sensation. Typical settings: energy flux density of 0.01-0.30 mJ/mm2 (adjusted based on condition and tolerance), frequency of 5-15 Hz, and 1,500-4,000 impulses per treatment area. The applicator is moved slowly across the area, spending extra time on the most painful points. Total treatment time per area is 5-15 minutes. 04 
#### Intensity Adjustment 

Your provider starts at a lower energy setting and gradually increases based on your feedback. The treatment should be uncomfortable but tolerable--most patients rate it a 4-6 out of 10 on a pain scale. The point of maximum tenderness (the "sweet spot") often correlates with the epicenter of pathology. Your feedback guides the treatment. 05 
#### Post-Treatment 

The gel is wiped off and you're done. No bandaging, no restrictions on driving, no recovery period. You walk out and return to your day. Mild soreness in the treated area is normal for 1-2 days. You can return for your next session in approximately one week. 

**Treatment protocol: **Most conditions respond to 3-6 sessions spaced 1 week apart. The one-week interval is important--it gives the tissue time to initiate the healing response triggered by each session before the next round of stimulation. More sessions aren't always better; the protocol is designed around the biology of tissue repair. 
### WHAT CONDITIONS IT TREATS 

Shockwave therapy is most effective for chronic tendon injuries and conditions that haven't responded to rest, physical therapy, or injections. Here are the primary indications. 
#### Plantar Fasciitis Strongest Evidence 

The single most studied indication for shockwave therapy. Chronic plantar fasciitis--especially cases that have failed 6+ months of conservative treatment--responds exceptionally well. Systematic reviews show 65-80% of patients achieve significant pain reduction and functional improvement. The 2020 Cochrane-level evidence supports ESWT as a first-line non-invasive treatment for recalcitrant plantar fasciitis before considering surgery. 
#### Calcific Shoulder Tendinopathy Strongest Evidence 

Calcium deposits in the rotator cuff tendons cause significant pain and limited range of motion. This is arguably where shockwave therapy shines brightest. Multiple high-quality RCTs and meta-analyses demonstrate over 80% calcium resorption rates with focused shockwave. Pain relief and functional improvement persist at 6- and 12-month follow-ups. The NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) and multiple international guidelines recommend ESWT for this condition. 
#### Achilles Tendinopathy Strong Evidence 

Both insertional and mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy respond to shockwave therapy. Meta-analyses show 60-75% improvement rates for pain and function. Shockwave is particularly valuable for insertional Achilles tendinopathy, where eccentric loading exercises (the gold standard for mid-portion disease) are often less effective. Evidence supports ESWT as a treatment option when physical therapy alone hasn't resolved symptoms. 
#### Lateral Epicondylitis (Tennis Elbow) Strong Evidence 

Chronic tennis elbow that hasn't responded to bracing, therapy, or injections is a strong candidate for shockwave. Studies show 60-75% improvement rates. Importantly, shockwave avoids the tendon-weakening effects of repeated cortisone injections, which are increasingly being questioned for this condition. Multiple RCTs support ESWT as superior to placebo and comparable to surgery for chronic cases. 
#### Medial Epicondylitis (Golfer's Elbow) Strong Evidence 

Similar to tennis elbow but on the inner aspect of the elbow. Less studied than lateral epicondylitis but the mechanism is the same--chronic tendinopathy of the common flexor origin. Available studies show comparable response rates to lateral epicondylitis treatment. A reasonable option when conservative treatment has failed. 
#### Rotator Cuff Tendinopathy (Non-Calcific) Strong Evidence 

Chronic rotator cuff tendinopathy without calcium deposits also responds to shockwave therapy, though the evidence is slightly less robust than for the calcific variant. Studies show improvement in pain and function, particularly for supraspinatus tendinopathy. Often used in combination with a structured rehabilitation program for best results. 
#### Patellar Tendinopathy (Jumper's Knee) Strong Evidence 

A notoriously difficult condition to treat, especially in athletes who can't fully rest. Shockwave therapy has shown 50-65% improvement rates for chronic patellar tendinopathy. While response rates are somewhat lower than for plantar fasciitis or calcific shoulder disease, shockwave remains one of the better non-surgical options for this stubborn condition, particularly when eccentric loading alone hasn't worked. 
#### Greater Trochanteric Pain Syndrome Strong Evidence 

Previously called "trochanteric bursitis," this condition involves tendinopathy of the gluteal tendons at the hip. It's common in runners and active adults. Shockwave therapy has shown significant improvements in pain and function, with RCTs demonstrating superiority over corticosteroid injection at 12-month follow-up. The LEAP trial (2018) established shockwave as a viable treatment option for this condition. 
#### Myofascial Trigger Points Moderate Evidence 

Radial shockwave can be effective for myofascial trigger points--those painful knots in muscle that refer pain to other areas. The mechanical energy disrupts the dysfunctional motor endplate activity that maintains the trigger point, reduces local ischemia, and stimulates blood flow. Studies show improvements in pain and range of motion, particularly in the upper trapezius and other chronic trigger point areas. 
#### Medial Tibial Stress Syndrome (Shin Splints) Moderate Evidence 

Chronic shin splints that haven't resolved with rest and load management can respond to shockwave therapy. The treatment targets the periosteal and muscular pathology along the medial tibial border. Emerging evidence shows promising results, particularly for athletes and military personnel dealing with recurrent symptoms. Often combined with gait retraining and gradual return-to-running programs. 
### THE EVIDENCE BASE 

Shockwave therapy is not a fringe treatment. It has one of the strongest evidence bases of any non-invasive musculoskeletal intervention, supported by hundreds of published studies, dozens of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and multiple systematic reviews and meta-analyses. 
#### Plantar Fasciitis 

A 2017 meta-analysis in the British Medical Bulletin analyzing 11 RCTs found ESWT significantly reduced pain in chronic plantar fasciitis compared to placebo, with success rates of 65-80%. A 2019 meta-analysis in the Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery and Research confirmed these findings and noted sustained improvements at 12-month follow-up. 
#### Calcific Shoulder Tendinopathy 

High-energy focused ESWT for calcific rotator cuff tendinopathy has produced some of the most impressive results in the literature. The landmark RCT by Gerdesmeyer et al. (2003) demonstrated over 80% calcium resorption and significant pain improvement at 6-month follow-up. Subsequent meta-analyses have consistently confirmed these findings. 
#### Tennis Elbow 

A 2020 systematic review in the American Journal of Sports Medicine found ESWT produced clinically meaningful improvements in chronic lateral epicondylitis that persisted at long-term follow-up. Notably, ESWT showed advantages over corticosteroid injection at time points beyond 3 months, as steroid effects tend to diminish while shockwave benefits compound. 
#### Achilles Tendinopathy 

Multiple systematic reviews support ESWT for chronic Achilles tendinopathy, with a 2015 meta-analysis in the British Journal of Sports Medicine showing significant improvements in VISA-A scores (the validated outcome measure for Achilles tendinopathy). Results were particularly strong for insertional Achilles tendinopathy, where other conservative options are limited. 

**Context: **International guidelines from NICE (UK), ISMST (International Society for Medical Shockwave Treatment), and multiple national orthopedic and sports medicine societies include ESWT in their recommendations for chronic tendinopathies. The treatment has been used clinically for over 20 years with an established safety profile. This isn't experimental--it's an evidence-based treatment that has earned its place in musculoskeletal care. 
### WHAT TO EXPECT DURING AND AFTER TREATMENT 
#### During Treatment 

**Sensation: **You'll feel a rapid, repetitive tapping or pulsing at the treatment site. It's not sharp--more like a deep pressure or knocking. Most patients describe it as uncomfortable but tolerable. 

**Intensity: **Your provider adjusts the energy level based on your feedback. The goal is to work at a level that is therapeutic but manageable. If it's too intense, say so--the setting gets dialed down immediately. 

**Duration: **5-15 minutes per treatment area. Most sessions are done in under 10 minutes. If multiple areas are treated in the same visit, the total time increases accordingly. 

**Anesthesia: **Radial shockwave does not require anesthesia. Focused shockwave at higher energy levels may use a topical numbing cream for comfort, though some protocols avoid it since pain feedback guides treatment accuracy. 
#### After Treatment 

**Immediate: **No downtime. You can walk out, drive, and return to normal activities immediately. Most people go back to work the same day without restriction. 

**Soreness: **Mild soreness or aching in the treated area for 1-2 days is normal and expected. This is part of the therapeutic inflammatory response. Light redness or warmth at the treatment site may occur. 

**Avoid NSAIDs: **Do not take ibuprofen, naproxen, or other anti-inflammatory medications for 2-3 days after treatment. These drugs blunt the inflammatory healing response that shockwave is specifically designed to trigger. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is fine if you need pain relief. 

**Timeline: **Don't expect instant results. The healing process shockwave initiates takes time. Most patients begin noticing improvement after the second or third session, with continued gains over 6-12 weeks as tissue remodels. Full benefit is typically realized 3-4 months after completing the treatment series. 
### SHOCKWAVE VS OTHER TREATMENTS 

Understanding how shockwave compares to other common treatments helps clarify where it fits in a treatment plan. These aren't always either-or decisions--sometimes they're complementary. 
#### Shockwave vs Cortisone Injections 

This is the most important comparison. Cortisone (corticosteroid) injections suppress inflammation and provide short-term pain relief--often within days. But they do not heal tissue. In fact, repeated cortisone injections have been shown to weaken tendons, accelerate degeneration, and increase the risk of tendon rupture. Studies on lateral epicondylitis show that cortisone provides initial relief but leads to worse outcomes at 6 and 12 months compared to no injection at all. 

Shockwave works in the opposite direction: it promotes healing by stimulating the body's regenerative response. It may not provide immediate pain relief like cortisone, but the improvements are sustained because the underlying tissue pathology is being addressed. For chronic tendinopathies, the evidence increasingly favors shockwave over repeated cortisone injections. 
#### Shockwave vs Surgery 

Surgery for chronic tendon conditions (debridement, release, or repair) is invasive, requires anesthesia, involves recovery time, and carries surgical risks including infection, nerve damage, and incomplete resolution. For conditions like plantar fasciitis, surgical success rates are comparable to shockwave therapy--but surgery comes with significantly more risk and downtime. 

This is why most orthopedic guidelines now recommend trying shockwave therapy before considering surgery for chronic tendinopathies. If shockwave doesn't provide adequate relief after a full course of treatment, surgery remains an option. But many patients who would have gone to surgery 15 years ago are now successfully treated with shockwave instead. 
#### Shockwave vs PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma) 

Both shockwave and PRP aim to stimulate the body's healing response--they just do it differently. PRP involves drawing blood, concentrating the platelets (which contain growth factors), and injecting them into the injured tissue. Shockwave delivers mechanical energy that triggers the same biological cascades without an injection. 

These treatments can be complementary. Some protocols use shockwave to prepare tissue and increase blood flow before a PRP injection, potentially enhancing the PRP's effectiveness. For patients who want to avoid injection-based treatments, shockwave offers a completely non-invasive alternative with a comparable evidence base. 
#### Shockwave vs Physical Therapy Alone 

Physical therapy--particularly eccentric loading programs--is the foundation of tendinopathy treatment and should almost always be part of the plan. Shockwave is not a replacement for rehabilitation; it's an accelerator. When combined with a structured rehab program, shockwave can help overcome the plateau that many chronic tendon patients hit with physical therapy alone. The best outcomes in the research typically come from ESWT combined with targeted exercise, not either modality in isolation. 
### COMMON QUESTIONS 
#### Is shockwave therapy painful? 

Most patients describe it as a strong tapping or pressure sensation. There is some discomfort, especially over the most tender areas, but the intensity is adjusted to your tolerance during treatment. Radial shockwave is generally well tolerated without anesthesia. Focused shockwave at higher energy levels may require topical numbing. Most people rate the discomfort as manageable--a 4 to 6 out of 10--and sessions only last 5 to 15 minutes. 
#### How many sessions do I need? 

Most protocols involve 3 to 6 sessions, spaced about 1 week apart. Some conditions respond in as few as 3 sessions, while more chronic or severe injuries may require the full 6. Your provider will assess your response after each session and adjust the plan accordingly. Many patients notice meaningful improvement by the third or fourth session. 
#### What's the success rate? 

Success rates vary by condition. For plantar fasciitis: 65-80% significant improvement. For calcific shoulder tendinopathy: over 80% for calcium resorption and pain relief. For tennis elbow and Achilles tendinopathy: 60-75% improvement rates. These are among the highest success rates for any non-invasive musculoskeletal treatment. Response depends on the specific condition, chronicity, and adherence to the full treatment protocol. 
#### Does insurance cover shockwave therapy? 

Most insurance plans in the United States do not cover shockwave therapy, as many insurers still consider it investigational despite strong clinical evidence. Some plans may cover it for specific FDA-cleared indications like plantar fasciitis. Check with your insurance provider for your specific plan. At Moonshot, we offer transparent pricing so you know the cost before you start. 
#### Can I exercise after treatment? 

You can return to light activity immediately. Avoid high-impact loading of the treated area for 24-48 hours. Low-impact exercise like walking, cycling, or swimming is fine. Importantly, avoid NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen) for 2-3 days after treatment--they can blunt the inflammatory healing response that shockwave is designed to trigger. Acetaminophen is fine if needed. 
#### Who should NOT get shockwave therapy? 

Shockwave therapy is contraindicated over open growth plates in children, over areas with active infection, over tumors or malignancies, in patients with blood clotting disorders or on anticoagulant therapy, during pregnancy (near the uterus), and directly over major nerve or vascular bundles. Patients with pacemakers should consult their cardiologist first. Your provider will screen for all contraindications before treatment.

Rehab & Recovery 
## TRIGGER POINT INJECTIONS 

What they are, how they mechanically and chemically disrupt chronic muscle knots, and what to expect from the procedure. 
### WHAT ARE TRIGGER POINT INJECTIONS? 

A trigger point injection (TPI) is a medical procedure where a small needle is inserted directly into a myofascial trigger point and a therapeutic solution is injected. The needle itself mechanically disrupts the contracted muscle fibers at the trigger point, while the injected medication provides additional pain relief, reduces local inflammation, and helps the muscle relax. 

The procedure is quick, performed in-office, and provides relief that ranges from immediate to within a few days depending on the severity and chronicity of the trigger point. For many patients, it's the intervention that finally breaks the pain cycle that stretching, massage, and over-the-counter medications couldn't resolve. 

Trigger point injections have been a staple of pain management and musculoskeletal medicine for decades. They're well-studied, widely used, and effective for a range of conditions rooted in myofascial dysfunction. 

**Key point: **Trigger point injections work through a dual mechanism. The needle physically disrupts the dysfunctional tissue (similar to dry needling), while the injected solution adds a chemical component that enhances pain relief and muscle relaxation. This combination is often more effective than either approach alone. 
### WHAT ARE TRIGGER POINTS? 

A trigger point is a hyperirritable spot within a taut band of skeletal muscle. If you've ever felt a "knot" in your neck, shoulder, or back that's tender to the touch and causes pain to radiate to another area when pressed, you've felt a trigger point. 

Trigger points form when muscle fibers become stuck in a contracted state. This isn't a normal muscle contraction you can consciously release. The fibers are locked in a sustained shortening at the microscopic level, creating a palpable nodule within the muscle. 

How They Form 

Trigger points develop from sustained postures (desk work, phone use), repetitive motions (overhead lifting, typing), acute injury (whiplash, muscle strains), emotional stress (jaw clenching, shoulder guarding), or chronic overload without adequate recovery. Any situation where a muscle is held in contraction or repeatedly overworked beyond its recovery capacity can create trigger points. 

The Energy Crisis Theory (Simons & Travell) 

The most widely accepted explanation comes from Drs. Janet Travell and David Simons, who pioneered the field of myofascial pain. Their "integrated trigger point hypothesis" describes an energy crisis at the motor endplate (the junction where nerve meets muscle). Excessive acetylcholine release causes sustained muscle fiber contraction. This compression restricts local blood flow, creating an oxygen and energy deficit. The energy deficit prevents the muscle from releasing the contraction, and metabolic waste products accumulate, sensitizing local pain receptors. The result is a self-perpetuating cycle: contraction leads to ischemia, which leads to energy crisis, which prevents the muscle from relaxing. 

Local Pain vs. Referred Pain 

Trigger points cause two types of pain. Local pain is tenderness and aching right at the trigger point itself. Referred pain is the more distinctive feature: pressing on a trigger point in the upper trapezius can cause pain to radiate up into the head (a common cause of tension headaches). A trigger point in the infraspinatus can send pain down the arm. These referred pain patterns are consistent and well-mapped, which is what makes trigger points identifiable and treatable. 

Restricted Range of Motion 

Because the affected muscle fibers are locked in contraction, the muscle can't fully lengthen. This creates stiffness, limited range of motion, and compensatory movement patterns. Over time, surrounding muscles begin to overwork to compensate, often developing their own trigger points. A single untreated trigger point can cascade into a regional pain pattern. 
### HOW THE INJECTION WORKS 

Trigger point injections work through two complementary mechanisms: mechanical disruption from the needle and chemical effect from the injected solution. Understanding both explains why the procedure is more effective than simply taking a pain reliever or getting a massage. 
#### Mechanical Disruption 

The needle physically penetrates the trigger point and disrupts the dysfunctional motor endplate. This is similar to what happens in dry needling . The needle breaks up the contracted sarcomeres (the smallest contractile units of muscle fiber), interrupts the abnormal acetylcholine feedback loop, and creates a local microtrauma that stimulates a healing response. The "local twitch response" that often occurs during the procedure is a brief, involuntary contraction of the muscle fiber, which is a reliable sign that the needle has hit the trigger point and disrupted it. 
#### Chemical Effect 

The injected solution adds a second layer of therapeutic effect. Lidocaine (the most common injectate) provides immediate local anesthesia, blocking pain signals from the treated area and interrupting the pain-spasm-pain cycle. It also has direct muscle-relaxing properties. When a corticosteroid is added, it reduces local inflammation and can provide longer-lasting relief for trigger points with a significant inflammatory component. Even saline has been shown to be beneficial by diluting the concentrated metabolic waste products trapped in the trigger point and mechanically separating contracted fibers. 

**Why the combination matters: **Research consistently shows that the combination of mechanical needling plus an injected solution produces better outcomes than either alone. The needle disrupts the structural problem while the medication addresses the chemical environment. This is why trigger point injections often succeed where other treatments have plateaued. 
### WHAT'S INJECTED 

The solution injected into a trigger point varies depending on the clinical scenario. There isn't a single "best" option for every patient. A good provider matches the injectate to the specific presentation. 

Lidocaine (Most Common) 

Lidocaine is a local anesthetic and the most widely used injectate for trigger point injections. It provides immediate pain relief by blocking sodium channels in nerve fibers, preventing pain signal transmission. It also has direct muscle-relaxant properties. Lidocaine is preferred for most trigger point injections because it provides fast-acting relief, has a well-established safety profile, is unlikely to cause tissue irritation, and its anesthetic effect helps break the pain-spasm cycle immediately. Concentrations used are typically 0.5% to 1%, which is lower than what's used for procedures like dental work. 

Lidocaine + Corticosteroid 

When there's a significant inflammatory component, such as a trigger point associated with a chronic overuse injury or an acute flare-up with visible swelling or heat, a corticosteroid (such as triamcinolone or dexamethasone) may be combined with the lidocaine. The steroid provides potent anti-inflammatory effects that can extend the duration of relief. This combination is appropriate for chronic trigger points that haven't responded to lidocaine alone, trigger points near inflamed tendons or bursae, and patients with underlying inflammatory conditions. Steroid use is typically limited to avoid the tissue-thinning effects of repeated corticosteroid injections at the same site. 

Saline (Normal Saline) 

Isotonic saline (0.9% sodium chloride) is sometimes used as the injectate, particularly for patients who are sensitive or allergic to local anesthetics. Saline works by mechanically separating contracted muscle fibers, diluting the concentrated metabolic waste products and inflammatory mediators trapped in the trigger point, and providing a volume effect that stretches the local tissue. Studies have shown that saline injections into trigger points can be effective, reinforcing the importance of the mechanical needling component of the procedure. 

Dry Needling (No Injectate) 

Technically, dry needling uses no injected solution at all. The needle alone provides the mechanical disruption. While not a "trigger point injection" in the traditional sense, it's part of the same treatment spectrum. Dry needling is often performed by physical therapists and chiropractors and relies entirely on the mechanical disruption mechanism. Some patients prefer it because no medication is involved. We cover the comparison between TPIs and dry needling in detail below. 
### HOW THE PROCEDURE IS PERFORMED 

The procedure is straightforward, performed in-office, and typically completed in 10 to 20 minutes. 01 
#### Identification & Palpation 

The provider palpates the affected muscle to locate the trigger point. This involves running their fingers across the muscle fibers to find the taut band, then isolating the nodule within it. The trigger point is pinched or pressed between two fingers (or between a finger and the underlying bone) to stabilize it for needle insertion. The patient confirms the location by recognizing their familiar pain pattern when the point is pressed. 02 
#### Skin Preparation 

The skin over the trigger point is cleaned with an antiseptic solution (typically alcohol or chlorhexidine) to minimize infection risk. Some providers apply a topical numbing spray (ethyl chloride or vapocoolant) to reduce the initial needle stick sensation, though this is optional since the discomfort from the insertion is brief. 03 
#### Needle Insertion & Injection 

A small-gauge needle (typically 22 to 25 gauge) is inserted directly into the trigger point. The provider advances the needle into the taut band while injecting the solution. A key technique is "fanning" or "peppering," where the needle is partially withdrawn and redirected multiple times through the trigger point in slightly different directions. This ensures the entire trigger point is mechanically disrupted and the solution is distributed throughout the affected area. 04 
#### Local Twitch Response 

When the needle penetrates the trigger point, the patient often experiences a brief, involuntary muscle twitch. This local twitch response (LTR) is a good sign. Research by Hong and Simons showed that eliciting a local twitch response during needling is associated with significantly better treatment outcomes. It confirms the needle is in the right spot and that the dysfunctional motor endplate is being disrupted. The twitch lasts a fraction of a second and, while it can be startling, is not painful. 05 
#### Post-Injection Care 

After the needle is removed, the provider applies direct pressure to the injection site for 1 to 2 minutes to prevent bleeding and help distribute the solution. The patient is then guided through gentle stretching of the treated muscle. This post-injection stretch is important because it helps restore the muscle to its full resting length while the trigger point is deactivated and the area is anesthetized. 
### WHAT CONDITIONS DO TRIGGER POINT INJECTIONS TREAT? 

Trigger point injections are effective for any condition where myofascial trigger points are a primary or contributing cause of pain. That covers a wide range of musculoskeletal complaints. 
#### Chronic Neck & Shoulder Tension 

The upper trapezius and levator scapulae are among the most common trigger point locations. Desk work, phone use, and stress create sustained contraction in these muscles. Trigger points here cause neck stiffness, shoulder pain, and frequently refer pain into the head. 
#### Tension Headaches 

Many tension-type headaches are caused or exacerbated by trigger points in the upper trapezius, sternocleidomastoid, suboccipital, and temporalis muscles. These trigger points refer pain into the head in patterns that mimic tension headaches. Deactivating the trigger points can reduce headache frequency and intensity. 
#### Low Back Pain 

Trigger points in the quadratus lumborum, paraspinal muscles, gluteus medius, and piriformis are frequent contributors to chronic low back pain. These trigger points can mimic disc-related pain, sciatica, or sacroiliac joint dysfunction. Identifying and treating the myofascial component often provides relief that imaging-guided interventions miss. 
#### Myofascial Pain Syndrome 

Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) is a chronic pain condition defined by the presence of multiple active trigger points. It's one of the most underdiagnosed causes of chronic musculoskeletal pain. Trigger point injections are a primary treatment modality for MPS, often combined with physical therapy and postural correction. 
#### Fibromyalgia 

While fibromyalgia involves widespread pain and central sensitization, many fibromyalgia patients have concurrent myofascial trigger points that amplify their pain. Treating these peripheral pain generators with trigger point injections can reduce overall pain burden and improve quality of life as part of a comprehensive management plan. 
#### TMJ-Related Muscle Pain 

The masseter, temporalis, and medial pterygoid muscles can develop trigger points from jaw clenching, teeth grinding (bruxism), or TMJ dysfunction. These trigger points cause jaw pain, limited mouth opening, and can refer pain to the teeth, ear, and temple. Trigger point injections to the masticatory muscles can provide significant relief. 
#### Chronic Muscle Spasms 

Recurrent or persistent muscle spasms that don't respond to stretching, heat, or oral muscle relaxants are often driven by underlying trigger points. The injection breaks the spasm cycle at its source rather than masking it systemically with medication. 
#### Post-Injury Muscle Guarding 

After an injury (car accident, sports injury, fall), surrounding muscles often "guard" by tightening protectively. This guarding can persist long after the original injury heals, creating chronic trigger points that become a secondary pain source. Trigger point injections can release this residual muscle guarding and accelerate return to normal function. 
### WHAT TO EXPECT 

Knowing what the experience is actually like helps you prepare and set realistic expectations. 
#### During the Procedure 

You'll feel a mild sting when the needle enters the skin, similar to a blood draw. As the needle reaches the trigger point, you may feel a brief deep ache or cramping sensation, followed by the local twitch response (a quick involuntary muscle jump). This is the moment the trigger point is disrupted. The entire injection takes about 15 to 30 seconds per trigger point. Most patients describe the discomfort as brief and very tolerable, especially compared to the chronic pain they've been dealing with. 
#### Immediately After 

Many patients feel immediate relief as the lidocaine takes effect and the trigger point is deactivated. The muscle often feels noticeably looser and range of motion improves right away. Some patients describe a "release" sensation, as if the muscle has finally let go of tension it's been holding for weeks or months. 
#### 24 to 48 Hours Post-Injection 

As the lidocaine wears off (usually within a few hours), you may experience soreness at the injection site. This is normal and similar to the feeling after a deep tissue massage or an intense workout. Mild bruising can occur. Applying ice and gentle stretching during this period helps. Avoid intense exercise or heavy loading of the treated muscle for 24 to 48 hours. 
#### Full Effect 

The full benefit of the injection typically develops over the first 3 to 7 days as the local inflammation resolves and the muscle adapts to its restored resting length. Some patients experience complete resolution after a single treatment. Chronic or longstanding trigger points may require a series of sessions spaced 2 to 4 weeks apart, often combined with corrective exercises and postural modifications to prevent recurrence. 
#### Long-Term Outlook 

Trigger point injections are most effective when combined with an active approach: corrective stretching, strengthening weak muscles, ergonomic adjustments, and addressing the root cause that created the trigger points in the first place. The injection breaks the pain cycle and restores function. The follow-up rehab keeps it from coming back. 
### TRIGGER POINT INJECTIONS VS. DRY NEEDLING 

Both trigger point injections and dry needling target the same structures: myofascial trigger points. They share the same mechanical disruption mechanism. The key difference is whether a solution is injected. 
#### Trigger Point Injections 

- Needle insertion plus an injected solution (lidocaine, corticosteroid, or saline) 
- Performed by physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants 
- Dual mechanism: mechanical disruption plus chemical effect 
- Often provides faster initial relief due to the anesthetic component 
- Better suited for patients with severe pain who need immediate relief 
- Can include anti-inflammatory medication for inflammatory presentations 
- Typically uses a larger gauge needle (22-25 gauge) 
#### Dry Needling 

- Needle insertion without any injected solution 
- Performed by physical therapists, chiropractors, and other trained providers 
- Relies solely on mechanical disruption of the trigger point 
- May require more needle manipulation to achieve full effect 
- Preferred by patients who want to avoid any medication 
- Often uses thinner acupuncture-style needles (filiform needles) 
- Can be integrated into a physical therapy treatment session 

**The bottom line: **These are complementary approaches, not competing ones. Some patients respond better to one than the other. In many cases, using both within a treatment plan produces the best results. A trigger point injection can break through a severe, longstanding trigger point, and follow-up dry needling during physical therapy can maintain the result and address secondary trigger points. The best approach depends on the severity of the trigger point, your pain tolerance, your treatment goals, and your provider's clinical judgment. 
### COMMON QUESTIONS 
#### How long does a trigger point injection take? 

The injection itself takes about 15 to 30 seconds per trigger point. A full session treating multiple trigger points typically takes 10 to 20 minutes, including preparation. Most patients are in and out of the office within 30 minutes. 
#### How many sessions will I need? 

It depends on the severity and chronicity of your trigger points. Some patients experience complete relief after a single session. Chronic or recurring trigger points may require a series of 3 to 6 sessions spaced 2 to 4 weeks apart. Your provider will assess your response after each treatment and adjust the plan accordingly. The goal is always resolution, not indefinite treatment. 
#### What are the side effects? 

The most common side effect is temporary soreness at the injection site, similar to a deep bruise, lasting 24 to 48 hours. Minor bruising can occur. Serious side effects are rare but can include infection at the injection site (minimized by proper skin preparation), allergic reaction to the anesthetic (uncommon with lidocaine), or temporary numbness if a nerve is near the injection site. When performed by a trained provider using proper technique, trigger point injections are very safe. 
#### Does insurance cover trigger point injections? 

Many insurance plans cover trigger point injections when they are medically necessary and performed by a licensed provider. Coverage varies by plan and diagnosis. Trigger point injections are billed under CPT codes 20552 (1 to 2 muscles) or 20553 (3 or more muscles). Check with your insurance provider for specific coverage details, or ask our office to verify benefits before your appointment. 
#### Can I exercise after a trigger point injection? 

Light activity and gentle stretching are encouraged after the injection. Avoid intense exercise or heavy loading of the treated muscle group for 24 to 48 hours to allow the tissue to recover and reduce the risk of rebound soreness. After that window, you can return to normal activity. Your provider may also recommend specific stretches or corrective exercises to maximize the benefit of the injection and prevent the trigger point from returning.

Rehab & Recovery 
## CHIROPRACTIC CARE & THE MCKENZIE METHOD 

What evidence-based chiropractic care actually looks like, how the McKenzie Method works, what conditions it treats, and why our approach is designed to make you independent -- not dependent. 
### WHAT IS EVIDENCE-BASED CHIROPRACTIC? 

Chiropractic care, at its core, involves the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of musculoskeletal conditions -- primarily those involving the spine. The practitioner uses manual techniques including joint manipulation, mobilization, and soft tissue work to restore function, reduce pain, and improve movement. 

But not all chiropractic is the same. The profession has a wide spectrum. On one end, you have traditional subluxation-based chiropractic, which operates on the theory that vertebral misalignments ("subluxations") interfere with nervous system function and cause disease. This model often emphasizes lifelong maintenance adjustments -- weekly or biweekly visits indefinitely, regardless of symptoms. On the other end, you have evidence-based chiropractic, which uses clinical research, specific diagnosis, measurable outcomes, and defined treatment endpoints to guide care. 

The difference matters. Evidence-based chiropractic treats a specific problem with a specific plan and a specific endpoint. You come in with a complaint, you get assessed, you get treated, you learn how to manage it, and you leave. The goal is discharge, not dependence. You should not need to see a chiropractor every week for the rest of your life any more than you should need to see a physical therapist every week for the rest of your life. 

At Moonshot, we practice evidence-based chiropractic with a strong emphasis on the McKenzie Method. Treatment combines manual therapy -- manipulation and mobilization where clinically indicated -- with corrective exercise, patient education, and self-management strategies. The measure of success is not how many visits you attend. It's how quickly you become independent. 

**Key distinction: **If a chiropractor tells you that you need to come in multiple times per week for months or years with no defined endpoint, that's a business model, not a treatment plan. Evidence-based care has measurable goals, objective progress markers, and a discharge plan from day one. 
### THE MCKENZIE METHOD (MDT) 

The McKenzie Method -- formally known as Mechanical Diagnosis and Therapy (MDT) -- was developed by New Zealand physiotherapist Robin McKenzie in the 1960s. It is one of the most extensively researched and widely used assessment and treatment systems for spinal and extremity conditions in the world. Over 4,000 clinicians in more than 30 countries are credentialed in MDT through the McKenzie Institute International. 

The central premise is mechanical: most musculoskeletal pain has a mechanical cause, and therefore it has a mechanical solution. The clinician's job is to identify which specific movements and positions make the patient better and which make them worse -- then use that information to classify the problem and design a treatment strategy built around patient self-treatment. 

The Three Syndromes 

MDT classifies musculoskeletal conditions into three mechanical syndromes, each with distinct characteristics and treatment approaches. This classification drives treatment -- the syndrome determines the strategy, not a one-size-fits-all protocol. 

1. Derangement Syndrome 

The most common classification, accounting for roughly 70-80% of spinal presentations. Derangement involves a disturbance in the normal resting position of the joint's articular surfaces -- often involving the intervertebral disc. The hallmark feature is a directional preference: the patient's symptoms change (improve or worsen) in a predictable and repeatable way with specific movements or sustained positions. For example, a patient with a lumbar derangement may find that repeated extension (backward bending) centralizes their pain -- moves it from the leg or buttock back toward the midline of the spine -- while flexion peripheralizes it (sends it further into the leg). The treatment is to load the spine in the direction of preference repeatedly. The concept of centralization -- originally described by McKenzie and later validated by research from Donelson, Long, and others -- is a strong positive prognostic indicator. Patients who centralize tend to have better outcomes regardless of what specific treatment they receive. 

2. Dysfunction Syndrome 

Dysfunction involves pain produced at the end range of movement due to shortened or scarred soft tissue -- adhesions, fibrosis, or adaptive shortening from prolonged immobility, prior injury, or surgery. The pain is produced only at the endpoint of the restricted movement, not during the movement itself. The pain does not change location or intensity with repeated movements (unlike derangement). Treatment involves repeated loading at end range to remodel the shortened tissue and progressively restore normal range of motion. This is a slower process -- tissue remodeling takes weeks to months. 

3. Postural Syndrome 

Postural syndrome involves pain caused by sustained end-range loading of normal tissue -- essentially, pain from holding a position too long. There is no pathology, no tissue damage, and no movement restriction. The pain is produced by prolonged positioning (sitting slouched for hours, for example) and is immediately abolished by correcting the posture. Treatment is education: correct the posture, correct the ergonomics, and the pain resolves. No manipulation, no exercise, no ongoing treatment. This is the simplest syndrome but often the most overlooked. 

Directional Preference 

The concept of directional preference is central to MDT and backed by substantial research. During the mechanical assessment, the clinician tests repeated movements in multiple directions -- flexion, extension, lateral movements, rotation -- and observes the response. If one direction consistently reduces, centralizes, or abolishes the patient's symptoms, that is the directional preference. Treatment is then built around loading the spine or joint in that specific direction through repeated end-range movements. This is not guesswork -- it is a systematic, testable, reproducible clinical finding. A 2004 study by Long et al. published in *Spine *showed that patients who received exercises matching their directional preference had significantly better outcomes than those who received non-matching or general exercises. 

Why Self-Treatment Matters 

The single most important feature of MDT is the emphasis on patient self-treatment. The clinician identifies the syndrome, determines the directional preference, and then teaches the patient specific exercises and positions to perform independently -- multiple times per day, at home, at work, wherever they are. The patient becomes their own therapist. This is not a philosophical preference; it is a clinical strategy. A condition driven by mechanical forces needs to be managed with mechanical forces applied frequently. A 20-minute clinic visit twice per week cannot compete with a patient who performs their directional exercises 6-8 times per day. The math is straightforward: self-treatment provides a higher dose of the therapeutic stimulus. 
### HOW CHIROPRACTIC TREATMENT WORKS 

Chiropractic treatment uses manual techniques -- primarily joint manipulation and mobilization -- to restore normal joint mechanics, reduce pain, and improve function. The mechanisms are well studied, though the field continues to refine its understanding. Here's what happens physiologically when a chiropractor treats you: 
#### Joint Manipulation (High-Velocity, Low-Amplitude Thrust) 

Spinal manipulation -- the "adjustment" -- involves a controlled, quick thrust applied to a joint that has restricted motion. The high-velocity, low-amplitude (HVLA) thrust takes the joint briefly past its passive range of motion but within its anatomical limit. The audible "pop" or "crack" (cavitation) is simply the release of gas bubbles from the synovial fluid within the joint capsule as the joint surfaces separate momentarily. The sound is not bones cracking and is not required for a successful treatment. 

Mechanically, manipulation restores joint mobility by breaking adhesions, stretching the joint capsule, and resetting the mechanoreceptors that provide the brain with information about joint position and movement. Neurophysiologically, the thrust activates large-diameter mechanoreceptors (A-beta fibers) in the joint capsule and surrounding tissues, which inhibit pain signaling at the spinal cord level via the gate control mechanism first described by Melzack and Wall in 1965. This is why patients often experience immediate pain relief and improved range of motion after an adjustment -- the neurological input has changed, even before any structural tissue remodeling occurs. 
#### Joint Mobilization (Low-Velocity, Graded Oscillations) 

Mobilization is a gentler approach that uses slow, rhythmic, oscillating movements applied within the joint's available range of motion. Maitland graded mobilizations range from Grade I (small amplitude, beginning of range) to Grade IV (large amplitude, end of range). Grade V is the HVLA thrust described above. Mobilization is used when manipulation is contraindicated, when the patient prefers a gentler approach, or when the clinical picture calls for it -- such as in acute, highly irritable presentations where a thrust would be too provocative. 

The physiological effects overlap with manipulation: stimulation of mechanoreceptors, activation of the gate control mechanism, reduced muscle guarding, and improved joint nutrition through enhanced synovial fluid circulation. Mobilization also has a well-documented effect on reducing sympathetic nervous system tone, which helps decrease the muscle guarding and hypertonicity that often accompany painful spinal conditions. 
#### Muscle Guarding and Reflex Inhibition 

Painful spinal conditions almost always involve protective muscle guarding -- the body splints the area with sustained muscle contraction to prevent movement of the painful segment. This guarding is reflexive and involuntary, mediated by spinal cord reflexes. While initially protective, sustained guarding creates its own pain cycle: the chronically contracted muscles develop ischemia, accumulate metabolic waste, and become a secondary pain source. 

Both manipulation and mobilization interrupt this cycle. The mechanical input from the treatment stimulates proprioceptive pathways that override the guarding reflex, allowing the paraspinal muscles to relax. Research using surface EMG has demonstrated immediate reductions in paraspinal muscle activity following spinal manipulation. This is one reason patients feel "looser" immediately after treatment -- the muscles have genuinely reduced their tone. 
#### McKenzie-Specific Mechanisms: Repeated End-Range Loading 

In the McKenzie Method, the primary treatment tool for derangement syndrome is repeated end-range loading -- moving the joint to the end of its available range in the directional preference and repeating that movement multiple times. The proposed mechanism involves hydraulic effects on the intervertebral disc: repeated loading in the direction of preference may influence the position of nuclear material within the disc, reducing pressure on pain-sensitive structures (the posterior annulus and adjacent nerve roots). 

The centralization phenomenon -- where pain progressively moves from the periphery (arm or leg) back toward the midline of the spine during repeated movements -- is a key clinical finding. Centralization has been validated as both a classification tool and a prognostic indicator. Werneke and Hart (2001) demonstrated that patients who centralize during the initial assessment have significantly better outcomes at discharge and follow-up, regardless of the treatment approach used. This makes the McKenzie assessment valuable even when the treatment itself involves techniques outside the MDT framework. 
#### Descending Pain Modulation 

Beyond the local mechanical and segmental neurological effects, spinal manipulation activates descending inhibitory pain pathways from the brainstem -- specifically the periaqueductal gray (PAG) and rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM). This has been demonstrated in studies measuring temporal summation and pressure pain thresholds before and after manipulation. Bialosky et al. (2009) published a comprehensive neurophysiological model in *Manual Therapy *showing that manual therapy produces hypoalgesia (reduced pain sensitivity) through multiple overlapping mechanisms: peripheral, spinal, and supraspinal. The clinical effect is both local and regional pain relief -- explaining why a lumbar manipulation can improve pain not just at the treated segment but across the entire low back and into the lower extremities. 
### CONDITIONS TREATED 

Evidence-based chiropractic care with the McKenzie Method is effective for a wide range of musculoskeletal conditions. The following represent the most common presentations we treat: 
#### Low Back Pain 

The most common reason people see a chiropractor. Mechanical low back pain -- including facet joint dysfunction, disc-related pain, sacroiliac joint dysfunction, and nonspecific low back pain -- responds well to spinal manipulation combined with McKenzie directional exercises. The 2017 American College of Physicians guidelines recommend spinal manipulation as a first-line treatment for acute and chronic low back pain before considering medication. 
#### Neck Pain 

Cervical manipulation and mobilization are supported by multiple systematic reviews for mechanical neck pain. Common presentations include cervical facet dysfunction, acute torticollis, cervical disc irritation, and postural-related neck pain. The McKenzie assessment is particularly valuable for the cervical spine, where identifying a directional preference helps determine whether the patient needs extension, retraction, or lateral exercises. 
#### Disc Herniations & Bulges 

Contrary to what many patients believe, disc herniations and bulges are often effectively managed conservatively. McKenzie-based treatment with directional preference exercises is one of the most studied approaches for disc-related pain. The centralization response during assessment helps determine whether conservative management is appropriate. Research shows that patients with disc herniations who centralize have outcomes comparable to surgical patients at one-year follow-up. 
#### Sciatica 

True sciatica -- radicular pain following the sciatic nerve distribution into the posterior thigh and leg -- is typically caused by lumbar disc herniation compressing the L4, L5, or S1 nerve root. McKenzie exercises that centralize the leg pain (pulling it out of the leg and back toward the spine) are a primary treatment strategy. Spinal manipulation and neural mobilization techniques are used as adjuncts. Most cases resolve within 6-12 weeks with conservative care. 
#### Headaches (Cervicogenic & Tension-Type) 

Cervicogenic headaches originate from the upper cervical spine (C1-C3) and refer pain into the head via the trigeminocervical nucleus. Tension-type headaches are often perpetuated by cervical dysfunction and myofascial trigger points in the suboccipital, upper trapezius, and sternocleidomastoid muscles. Cervical manipulation, mobilization, and targeted exercises reduce headache frequency and intensity. A 2019 Cochrane review found moderate-quality evidence supporting spinal manipulative therapy for cervicogenic headache. 
#### Thoracic & Mid-Back Pain 

Thoracic pain is commonly related to costovertebral and costotransverse joint dysfunction, thoracic facet irritation, or postural strain from prolonged sitting. Thoracic manipulation is one of the most satisfying treatments in chiropractic -- it often produces immediate and significant relief. The thoracic spine is also treated when cervical or shoulder conditions are present, as thoracic hypomobility frequently contributes to compensatory cervical and shoulder dysfunction. 
#### Shoulder Impingement 

Shoulder impingement is rarely just a shoulder problem. Thoracic kyphosis, cervical dysfunction, and scapular dyskinesis are common contributors. Chiropractic treatment addresses the entire kinetic chain: thoracic manipulation to restore extension, cervical treatment to normalize nerve function to the shoulder girdle muscles, and targeted scapular stabilization exercises. The McKenzie Method includes extremity assessment protocols that apply the same directional preference principles to shoulder conditions. 
#### Post-Surgical Rehabilitation 

Following spinal surgery (discectomy, laminectomy, fusion), chiropractic care plays a role in restoring mobility to adjacent segments, addressing compensatory movement patterns, and preventing recurrence. Treatment is modified to respect surgical constraints -- no manipulation at the surgical level, focus on mobilization of adjacent segments and progressive exercise. McKenzie exercises are used to restore directional movement patterns and rebuild the patient's confidence in spinal loading. 
### WHAT THE EVIDENCE SAYS 

Both spinal manipulation and the McKenzie Method have substantial evidence bases. The research is clear: manual therapy combined with exercise is more effective than either alone, and evidence-based chiropractic care is a first-line treatment option for most common spinal conditions. 
#### Spinal Manipulation for Low Back Pain 

A 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis published in *JAMA *by Paige et al. evaluated 26 randomized controlled trials and concluded that spinal manipulative therapy is associated with statistically significant improvements in pain and function for acute low back pain. The American College of Physicians (ACP) 2017 clinical practice guidelines recommend spinal manipulation as a first-line, non-pharmacological treatment for both acute and chronic low back pain -- ahead of medications. 

The UK NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) guidelines similarly recommend manual therapy -- including spinal manipulation -- as part of a treatment package for low back pain with or without sciatica. These are not fringe endorsements; these are the most authoritative clinical practice guidelines in medicine. 
#### McKenzie Method Systematic Reviews 

A 2012 Cochrane review by Clare et al. examined the McKenzie Method for low back pain and found it produced greater short-term reductions in pain and disability compared to passive therapies. The review also noted that McKenzie was as effective as other standard treatments (general exercise, manipulation, stabilization exercises) but with the added advantage of promoting patient self-management and requiring fewer clinical visits. 

Lam et al. (2018) published a systematic review in the *Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy *evaluating MDT for spinal conditions. The review concluded that the McKenzie classification system demonstrates good reliability and that treatment matched to classification produces superior outcomes compared to unmatched or generic exercise programs. This is a critical finding: it validates the classification-based approach over the "one-size-fits-all" exercise prescription common in many clinics. 
#### Manipulation Plus Exercise vs. Either Alone 

Bronfort et al. (2011) published a landmark RCT in the *Annals of Internal Medicine *comparing spinal manipulation plus exercise to exercise alone and to medication alone for chronic low back pain. The combination of manipulation and exercise produced the best outcomes in both pain and patient satisfaction at 12-month follow-up. This supports the treatment model we use: manual therapy opens the window of opportunity -- reducing pain and restoring mobility -- and exercise exploits that window by reinforcing proper movement patterns and building stability. 

UK BEAM Trial (2004), published in the *BMJ *, randomized 1,334 patients with low back pain to four groups: best care in general practice, best care plus manipulation, best care plus exercise, and best care plus manipulation and exercise. The manipulation plus exercise group demonstrated the greatest improvement in function at 12 months. This was one of the largest pragmatic trials ever conducted for low back pain and directly supports the combined approach. 
#### Centralization and Outcomes 

Long et al. (2004) published a pivotal RCT in *Spine *that randomized 312 patients with low back pain (with or without leg pain) into three groups: exercises matching their directional preference, exercises opposite to their directional preference, and evidence-based general exercises. The directional preference group had significantly better outcomes in pain, function, and medication use. The opposite-direction group actually had worse outcomes than the general exercise group -- meaning that doing the wrong direction actively harmed patients. This study demonstrated that classification-based treatment is not just preferable; doing the wrong exercise can make people worse. 

**The bottom line: **Spinal manipulation is recommended as a first-line treatment for low back pain by the ACP, NICE, and multiple international guidelines. The McKenzie Method has Cochrane-level evidence supporting its effectiveness and its classification system. The combination of manipulation and matched exercise produces the best outcomes. This is not alternative medicine -- it is guideline-concordant, evidence-based care. 
### WHAT TO EXPECT 

Here is exactly what a course of care looks like from first visit to discharge: 
#### First Visit (45-60 Minutes) 

**History: **A detailed review of your complaint -- when it started, what makes it better or worse, how it affects your daily activities, prior treatments, imaging, and relevant medical history. This is not a checkbox form; it is a clinical conversation designed to identify the mechanical pattern of your condition. 

**Mechanical examination: **The core of the McKenzie assessment. You will be asked to perform repeated movements in multiple directions -- flexion, extension, lateral movements -- while the clinician observes and records the symptomatic response to each. This is how the directional preference is identified and the syndrome is classified. The mechanical exam also includes neurological screening (reflexes, sensation, muscle strength) when indicated. 

**Diagnosis and plan: **You will receive a clear explanation of what is going on, what syndrome classification you fall into, and what the treatment plan looks like -- including estimated number of visits and what you will be doing at home. If imaging is needed, it will be ordered. If your condition requires referral to another specialist, that will be communicated directly. 

**First treatment and home program: **Treatment begins on the first visit. You will leave with specific exercises to perform at home, with clear instructions on frequency, sets, and what responses to watch for. 
#### Follow-Up Visits (20-30 Minutes) 

Each follow-up begins with reassessment -- how did your symptoms respond to the home exercises? Did the pain centralize, decrease, stay the same, or worsen? This response data guides treatment progression. If centralization is occurring, the exercises are progressed. If the response is not as expected, the classification is revisited and the approach is adjusted. 

Treatment may include spinal manipulation or mobilization, soft tissue work, dry needling , and exercise instruction. The manual therapy component decreases over time as the patient becomes more proficient with self-management. The exercise program is progressively loaded -- starting with pain-modulating directional exercises and advancing to strength, stability, and functional exercises. 
#### Typical Course of Care (6-8 Visits) 

Most patients with acute or subacute conditions see significant improvement within 6 to 8 visits over 3 to 6 weeks. Acute presentations (recent onset, first episode) often resolve faster. Chronic conditions or post-surgical cases may require a longer course. Progress is tracked with objective measures: pain ratings, range of motion, functional outcomes (Oswestry Disability Index for low back, Neck Disability Index for cervical spine), and patient-reported improvement. 
#### Discharge 

You graduate when you have met your functional goals, your pain is resolved or well-managed, and you are confident in your self-management program. You leave with a maintenance exercise program -- what to do daily, what to do if symptoms recur, and what signs should prompt a return visit. The door is always open if something new comes up, but the expectation is that you will not need to return for the same problem. 
### COMMON QUESTIONS 
#### What is the McKenzie Method? 

The McKenzie Method, formally called Mechanical Diagnosis and Therapy (MDT), is a globally recognized assessment and treatment system developed by New Zealand physiotherapist Robin McKenzie. It emphasizes finding specific movements and positions that reduce your pain, then teaching you to use them yourself as self-treatment. Unlike traditional chiropractic that focuses on passive adjustments, MDT is designed to make you independent -- you learn what movements help your condition and how to manage flare-ups on your own. 
#### How is evidence-based chiropractic different from traditional chiropractic? 

Traditional chiropractic often centers on subluxation theory -- the idea that misaligned vertebrae cause disease -- and emphasizes maintenance visits indefinitely. Evidence-based chiropractic uses clinical research, specific diagnoses, and measurable outcomes to guide treatment. The goal is to resolve your problem and teach you self-management, not to create a dependency on ongoing adjustments. Treatment plans have defined endpoints, progress is tracked with objective measures, and discharge is the goal -- not lifetime care. 
#### How many visits will I need? 

It depends on the condition, how long you've had it, and how your body responds. Most patients see significant improvement within 6 to 8 visits. Acute issues -- like a recent onset of low back pain -- often resolve faster, sometimes in 3 to 4 visits. Chronic or complex conditions may require more. The key difference in our approach: we set clear milestones, track progress objectively, and discharge you when you've met your goals. The goal is always graduation, not maintenance. 
#### Do I need a referral for chiropractic care? 

No. In Illinois, chiropractors are primary contact providers, which means you can book directly without a referral from a physician. You do not need a prescription or authorization to be seen. If imaging or co-management with another provider is needed, your chiropractor can order or coordinate that directly. 
#### Does chiropractic care work for headaches? 

Yes. Cervicogenic headaches -- headaches originating from dysfunction in the cervical spine -- and tension-type headaches are two of the most responsive conditions to chiropractic treatment. The upper cervical joints (C1-C3) and the muscles of the suboccipital region refer pain into the head in well-documented patterns. Spinal manipulation, mobilization, and McKenzie-based exercises targeting the cervical spine can reduce headache frequency, intensity, and duration. Multiple clinical trials support this, including a 2019 systematic review in *Cephalalgia *showing spinal manipulative therapy is effective for cervicogenic headache.

### Cardiovascular & Lipid Optimization: Beyond Cholesterol
URL: https://moonshotmp.com/learn/cardiovascular-lipid-optimization/

Metabolic Health 
## CARDIOVASCULAR & LIPID OPTIMIZATION 

Total cholesterol and LDL-C are poor predictors of heart disease. The markers that actually matter — ApoB, LDL particle number, Lp(a), and insulin resistance — aren't on a standard lipid panel. Here's what real cardiovascular risk assessment looks like. 
### WHY STANDARD LIPID PANELS MISS THE REAL RISK 

The standard lipid panel — total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, and triglycerides — has been the default cardiovascular screening tool for decades. It was designed in an era when we understood far less about the biology of atherosclerosis. Today, the science has moved well beyond it. The clinical guidelines have not caught up. 

The core problem: total cholesterol and LDL-C measure the *concentration *of cholesterol inside lipoprotein particles. They do not tell you how many particles you have, how big or small they are, or whether your lipid profile is being driven by insulin resistance, genetics, thyroid dysfunction , or inflammation. Two patients with identical LDL-C values can have wildly different cardiovascular risk based on their particle number, particle size, Lp(a) status, and metabolic health. 

The INTERHEART study (Yusuf et al., 2004) — one of the largest case-control studies of myocardial infarction ever conducted, spanning 52 countries — found that the ApoB/ApoA1 ratio was a stronger predictor of heart attack than LDL-C. Ference et al. (2017), in a landmark Mendelian randomization analysis published in *JAMA Cardiology *, demonstrated that cardiovascular risk is determined by the number of ApoB-containing particles, not by the cholesterol mass they carry. The particle is the causal agent. The cholesterol inside it is a passenger. 

This means a "normal" LDL-C can coexist with dangerously high particle counts. And an "elevated" LDL-C can exist with low particle counts and low actual risk. Testing only LDL-C is like counting the number of passengers on a highway without counting the cars. The cars cause the accidents, not the passengers. 

**The takeaway: **Atherosclerosis is driven by ApoB-containing particles penetrating the arterial wall. Not by cholesterol floating in your blood. A standard lipid panel measures cholesterol concentrations. An advanced panel measures the particles that actually cause disease. These are different questions with different answers. 
### THE MARKERS THAT ACTUALLY MATTER 

If you want to understand your real cardiovascular risk, you need to go beyond LDL-C. These are the markers that drive clinical decisions at Moonshot — and the science behind each one. 

ApoB (Apolipoprotein B) 

Every atherogenic lipoprotein — LDL, VLDL, IDL, Lp(a), and chylomicron remnants — carries exactly one ApoB molecule on its surface. This makes ApoB a direct count of every particle in your blood that is capable of crossing the endothelium, embedding in the arterial wall, and initiating plaque formation. It is the single best predictor of cardiovascular risk available on a blood test. The European Atherosclerosis Society, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society, and the National Lipid Association have all endorsed ApoB as either equal or superior to LDL-C for risk assessment. When ApoB and LDL-C are discordant — meaning one is high and the other is normal — ApoB wins. Risk tracks with particle number, not cholesterol concentration. 

LDL Particle Number (LDL-P) vs. LDL Cholesterol (LDL-C) 

LDL-C tells you how much cholesterol is packed inside your LDL particles. LDL-P tells you how many LDL particles you actually have. These two numbers are concordant (both high or both low) in roughly 60-70% of patients. In the remaining 30-40%, they are discordant — and that discordance has massive clinical implications. A patient with low LDL-C but high LDL-P has far more risk than their standard panel suggests. This discordance is most common in patients with insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes — exactly the population at highest cardiovascular risk. The Framingham Offspring Study and the MESA trial both showed that LDL-P was a better predictor of cardiovascular events than LDL-C, especially when the two were discordant. 

Small Dense LDL vs. Large Buoyant LDL 

Not all LDL particles are created equal. Large buoyant LDL particles (Pattern A) are less atherogenic — they are less likely to penetrate the arterial wall, less susceptible to oxidation, and cleared from the bloodstream more efficiently. Small dense LDL particles (Pattern B) are the opposite: they penetrate the endothelium more easily, are more prone to oxidation, bind more readily to arterial proteoglycans, and have a longer circulating half-life. A patient dominated by small dense LDL has significantly more risk per particle. And here's the critical connection: insulin resistance is the primary driver of the shift from large buoyant to small dense LDL. High triglycerides and low HDL are the clinical clues that this shift has occurred. You can have a "normal" LDL-C and still be carrying a high concentration of the most dangerous particle subtype. 

Lp(a) — Lipoprotein(a) 

Lp(a) is an LDL-like particle with an additional apolipoprotein(a) protein attached. It is one of the strongest independent genetic risk factors for cardiovascular disease, affecting approximately 20% of the global population. Elevated Lp(a) increases the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and calcific aortic valve stenosis — and it does so independently of LDL-C, ApoB, and all other traditional risk factors. The critical fact: Lp(a) is almost entirely genetically determined. It is not meaningfully lowered by statins, diet, exercise, or lifestyle modification. Most physicians have never tested it. Most patients have never heard of it. If your Lp(a) is elevated, it fundamentally changes your risk profile and treatment strategy. Antisense oligonucleotide therapies targeting Lp(a) are in late-stage clinical trials, but today the primary approach is aggressive management of all other modifiable risk factors. You should test Lp(a) at least once in your lifetime. 

Triglyceride/HDL Ratio 

The triglyceride-to-HDL ratio is one of the simplest and most powerful metabolic markers available — and it is sitting on every standard lipid panel, hiding in plain sight. A TG/HDL ratio above 3.0 (in mg/dL) is a strong surrogate marker for insulin resistance, elevated small dense LDL, and increased cardiovascular risk. A ratio above 3.5 is highly predictive of metabolic syndrome. Conversely, a ratio below 2.0 generally indicates good insulin sensitivity and a favorable lipid particle profile. This single ratio often tells us more about a patient's metabolic health than LDL-C ever could. It costs nothing extra to calculate — the numbers are already on the standard panel — yet it is almost never discussed with patients. 

hs-CRP (High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein) 

Atherosclerosis is not just a lipid accumulation disease. It is an inflammatory disease. Lipid particles enter the arterial wall, but it is the immune response — macrophage infiltration, foam cell formation, cytokine release — that drives plaque growth, instability, and rupture. hs-CRP is a systemic marker of inflammation and is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events, even in patients with low LDL-C. The JUPITER trial (Ridker et al., 2008) demonstrated that patients with elevated hs-CRP but "normal" LDL-C still benefited from statin therapy — a finding that fundamentally challenged the cholesterol-centric model of heart disease. Optimal hs-CRP is below 1.0 mg/L. Values above 3.0 mg/L indicate elevated systemic inflammation and meaningfully increased cardiovascular risk. 

**Why this matters: **A standard lipid panel gives you four numbers. An advanced assessment gives you the actual risk picture: how many atherogenic particles you have (ApoB, LDL-P), what kind they are (small dense vs. large buoyant), whether you carry a genetic wild card (Lp(a)), whether insulin resistance is driving a hidden dyslipidemia (TG/HDL ratio), and whether your arteries are inflamed (hs-CRP). These are different questions. They require different tests. And they lead to fundamentally different treatment decisions. 
### INSULIN RESISTANCE: THE HIDDEN ENGINE OF HEART DISEASE 

If there is one root cause that ties together the majority of cardiovascular risk in the modern population, it is insulin resistance. Not cholesterol. Not genetics in most cases. Insulin resistance. 

When cells become resistant to insulin, the pancreas compensates by producing more. Chronically elevated insulin (hyperinsulinemia) drives a cascade of downstream effects that create the most common atherogenic lipid pattern we see in clinical practice — a pattern called **atherogenic dyslipidemia **: 
#### Elevated Triglycerides 

Insulin resistance increases hepatic VLDL production. The liver produces more triglyceride-rich particles, flooding the bloodstream with atherogenic remnants. Triglycerides above 150 mg/dL are a red flag. Above 200 mg/dL is a metabolic alarm. 
#### Low HDL-C 

Excess triglyceride-rich particles exchange triglycerides for cholesterol esters with HDL via CETP. This makes HDL particles triglyceride-enriched, which accelerates their clearance by the liver. The result: HDL drops. In men, HDL below 40 mg/dL and in women below 50 mg/dL signals metabolic dysfunction. 
#### Shift to Small Dense LDL 

The same CETP-mediated lipid exchange makes LDL particles triglyceride-enriched. Hepatic lipase then removes those triglycerides, leaving behind smaller, denser, cholesterol-depleted LDL particles. Each particle carries less cholesterol (so LDL-C may look "normal") but there are far more particles, and each one is more atherogenic. This is the concordance/discordance trap. 
#### Elevated ApoB 

More VLDL production plus more small dense LDL particles equals a higher total ApoB count — even when LDL-C is in the "normal" range. This is exactly why ApoB catches risk that LDL-C misses, and why it is especially important in the metabolically unhealthy population. 

This entire pattern — high triglycerides, low HDL, small dense LDL, elevated ApoB — is present in an estimated 40-50% of American adults. And a standard lipid panel will often miss it entirely because LDL-C may be within range. The patient is told their cholesterol is "fine." Meanwhile, their arteries are accumulating atherogenic particles at an accelerated rate. 

The connection to visceral fat is direct. DEXA body composition scans quantify visceral adipose tissue (VAT) — the metabolically active fat stored around the organs. VAT is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events, type 2 diabetes, and all-cause mortality, even in patients with a "normal" BMI. Visceral fat drives insulin resistance. Insulin resistance drives atherogenic dyslipidemia. This is why body composition data, not just blood work , is part of a real cardiovascular risk assessment. 

**The pattern: **Insulin resistance → increased hepatic VLDL output → elevated triglycerides → low HDL → small dense LDL → elevated ApoB → accelerated atherosclerosis. This is the most common pathway to cardiovascular disease in the modern world. And it has nothing to do with eating too many eggs. 
### THYROID, HORMONES, AND YOUR LIPID PROFILE 

Before reaching for a statin, a competent clinician should ask: *is anything else driving this lipid profile? *Two of the most common — and most overlooked — drivers are thyroid dysfunction and hormone imbalance. 

Hypothyroidism and Lipids 

Thyroid hormone (T3) directly upregulates LDL receptors in the liver. When T3 is low, LDL receptor expression drops, and the liver clears fewer LDL particles from the bloodstream. The result: elevated LDL-C and ApoB. Hypothyroidism also increases Lp(a) levels, raises total cholesterol, and impairs reverse cholesterol transport. Even subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH 2.5–10 mIU/L with normal Free T4) has been shown to significantly elevate LDL and total cholesterol. A meta-analysis by Razvi et al. (2008) demonstrated that treating subclinical hypothyroidism improved lipid profiles meaningfully. The clinical implication is straightforward: if you are prescribing a statin without checking a full thyroid panel, you may be medicating a thyroid problem. Fix the thyroid, and the lipids often normalize on their own. 

Testosterone and Cardiovascular Risk 

Testosterone at physiologic replacement doses generally has favorable effects on cardiovascular risk markers. It reduces triglycerides, improves insulin sensitivity, decreases visceral fat, and supports lean mass — all of which contribute to a better lipid profile and reduced atherosclerotic risk. Testosterone may modestly reduce HDL-C, but this effect is dose-dependent and needs to be interpreted in context: HDL-C is a poor proxy for cardiovascular risk compared to ApoB and particle metrics. The TRAVERSE trial (2023), a large randomized controlled trial, found no increase in major adverse cardiovascular events with testosterone replacement in hypogonadal men. Low testosterone , on the other hand, is independently associated with increased cardiovascular mortality, insulin resistance, increased visceral fat, and atherogenic dyslipidemia. Optimizing testosterone to physiologic levels is protective, not harmful. 

Estrogen, Progesterone, and Lipid Metabolism 

Estrogen increases LDL receptor expression and raises HDL-C — which is part of why premenopausal women have lower cardiovascular risk than age-matched men. The menopausal transition , with its decline in estrogen, is associated with unfavorable lipid changes: rising LDL, falling HDL, increasing triglycerides, and a shift toward smaller, denser LDL particles. Hormone replacement therapy in the early menopausal window has been shown to attenuate these changes. The point: lipid profiles don't exist in isolation. They are shaped by the entire endocrine environment. Treating lipids without evaluating thyroid and sex hormones is incomplete medicine. 

**The clinical sequence matters: **Evaluate thyroid function. Assess sex hormones. Quantify insulin resistance. Measure body composition and visceral fat. Address every root cause that is driving the lipid profile before defaulting to pharmacotherapy. This is not anti-medication. It is anti-treating-a-symptom-while-ignoring-the-cause. 
### TREATMENT PHILOSOPHY: ROOT CAUSE FIRST 

Moonshot's approach to cardiovascular and lipid optimization follows a clear hierarchy: identify and fix what is driving the problem before adding medication to suppress the numbers. This is not an ideological stance against statins. It is a commitment to treating *causes *rather than *markers *. 
#### Step 1: Advanced Diagnostics 

Full advanced lipid panel (ApoB, LDL-P, Lp(a), particle size distribution), metabolic markers (fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, HbA1c, fasting glucose), inflammatory markers (hs-CRP, homocysteine), full thyroid panel, sex hormones, and DEXA body composition scan with visceral fat quantification. You cannot treat what you have not measured. And you cannot identify root causes from a standard lipid panel. 
#### Step 2: Address Metabolic Root Causes 

If insulin resistance is driving the lipid profile — and it is in a large percentage of patients — the intervention is metabolic: body composition improvement (reducing visceral fat via caloric management and resistance training), dietary modification (reducing refined carbohydrates and processed foods, adequate protein), structured exercise (both resistance training and cardiovascular conditioning), sleep optimization, and stress management. If thyroid dysfunction is contributing, optimize thyroid. If hypogonadism is a factor, optimize testosterone or estrogen as appropriate. These are not "lifestyle recommendations" offered as lip service. They are primary interventions that address the mechanism driving disease. 
#### Step 3: Pharmacotherapy When Indicated 

Medication is appropriate — and sometimes essential — in the right clinical context. Statins, ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, icosapent ethyl (Vascepa), and bempedoic acid all have evidence-based roles. Statins are clearly indicated for secondary prevention (patients with established cardiovascular disease), familial hypercholesterolemia, persistently elevated ApoB after root-cause optimization, and elevated Lp(a) where aggressive LDL lowering provides marginal risk reduction. Where statins are overused: low-risk primary prevention patients with elevated LDL-C driven entirely by correctable metabolic dysfunction. The decision to start a statin should be based on particle-level data, inflammatory markers, metabolic status, and a full risk assessment — not on a single LDL-C number. 
#### Step 4: Ongoing Monitoring 

Cardiovascular risk management is not a one-time event. We recheck advanced lipid panels, metabolic markers, and inflammatory markers every 3–6 months during active optimization, then every 6–12 months once stable. DEXA scans are repeated every 6–12 months to track visceral fat trends. The goal is measurable, sustained improvement in the markers that actually predict outcomes — ApoB, hs-CRP, fasting insulin, and visceral fat — not just LDL-C on a standard panel. 

**The principle: **Medication is a tool, not a default. The first question is always "what is causing this?" The second question is "can we fix the cause?" The third question — and only when the first two are answered — is "does this patient also need pharmacotherapy?" That sequence matters. 
### WHAT WE TEST AND HOW OFTEN 

A real cardiovascular risk assessment requires more than four numbers on a standard panel. Here is what Moonshot's advanced cardiovascular and metabolic workup includes: Marker What It Tells Us Frequency ApoB Total atherogenic particle count — the single best blood marker of cardiovascular risk Every 3–6 months LDL-P (Particle Number) Direct LDL particle count, catches discordance with LDL-C Every 3–6 months Lp(a) Genetic cardiovascular risk factor, independent of all other lipid markers Once (genetically fixed) hs-CRP Systemic inflammation — the process that drives plaque growth and rupture Every 3–6 months Fasting Insulin & HOMA-IR Insulin resistance — the root driver of atherogenic dyslipidemia Every 3–6 months Triglycerides & HDL-C TG/HDL ratio as a proxy for insulin resistance and particle quality Every 3–6 months Full Thyroid Panel Hypothyroidism directly raises LDL and ApoB — must rule out before treating lipids Every 3–6 months HbA1c & Fasting Glucose Glycemic control and long-term blood sugar trends Every 3–6 months Homocysteine Independent cardiovascular risk factor, linked to B-vitamin metabolism Every 6–12 months DEXA (Visceral Fat / VAT) Visceral adipose tissue — the metabolically active fat that drives insulin resistance and CV risk Every 6–12 months 

**Lp(a) only needs to be tested once. **Because it is genetically determined, your Lp(a) level is essentially fixed for life. It does not respond to statins, diet, or exercise. One test gives you the answer. Every other marker is monitored longitudinally to track your response to treatment and quantify your trajectory over time. 
### COMMON QUESTIONS 
#### Why is ApoB a better predictor of cardiovascular risk than LDL cholesterol? 

LDL-C measures the amount of cholesterol carried inside LDL particles, but it doesn't tell you how many particles you have. Each atherogenic lipoprotein — LDL, VLDL, IDL, and Lp(a) — carries exactly one ApoB molecule on its surface. So ApoB gives you a direct count of every particle capable of penetrating the arterial wall and driving atherosclerosis. Two patients can have the same LDL-C but very different particle counts. The one with more particles (higher ApoB) has significantly more risk. The INTERHEART study, Ference et al. 2017, and multiple Mendelian randomization analyses have all confirmed that ApoB is a stronger predictor of cardiovascular events than LDL-C. This is why Moonshot tests ApoB on every advanced lipid panel. 
#### What is Lp(a) and why should I get tested? 

Lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a), is a genetically determined lipoprotein particle that is structurally similar to LDL but carries an additional protein called apolipoprotein(a). Elevated Lp(a) — which affects roughly 20% of the population — is an independent risk factor for heart attack, stroke, and aortic valve stenosis. The critical point: Lp(a) levels are largely determined by genetics and are not meaningfully lowered by statins, diet, or exercise. Most people have never had Lp(a) tested because it's not included on standard lipid panels. If your Lp(a) is elevated, it changes your entire risk calculus and treatment strategy. You only need to test it once because it doesn't change much over a lifetime. Everyone should know their number. 
#### Can insulin resistance cause high cholesterol? 

Yes. Insulin resistance is one of the most common drivers of atherogenic dyslipidemia — a pattern characterized by high triglycerides, low HDL, increased small dense LDL particles, and elevated ApoB. This happens because insulin resistance increases hepatic VLDL production, impairs lipoprotein lipase activity, and shifts LDL particles toward the smaller, denser, more atherogenic subtype. This pattern is often present even when LDL-C looks "normal" on a standard panel, which is why a standard lipid panel misses it entirely. Fixing the underlying insulin resistance — through body composition improvement, exercise, dietary modification, and metabolic optimization — often corrects the lipid pattern without medication. 
#### Does testosterone therapy affect cholesterol levels? 

At physiologic replacement doses, testosterone generally has a favorable or neutral effect on cardiovascular risk markers. It tends to reduce triglycerides, may modestly lower total and LDL cholesterol, and improves insulin sensitivity and body composition — all of which contribute to a better lipid profile. Testosterone can lower HDL-C slightly, but this effect is dose-dependent and the clinical significance is debated, especially since HDL-C is a poor predictor of risk compared to ApoB and particle metrics. Supraphysiologic doses (abuse-level dosing) are a different story and can significantly worsen lipid profiles. At Moonshot, we optimize testosterone to physiologic levels and monitor lipids as part of ongoing care. 
#### When do statins actually make sense? 

Statins are effective tools when used for the right patients. They make the most sense for patients with established cardiovascular disease (secondary prevention), persistently elevated ApoB or LDL-P despite lifestyle optimization, familial hypercholesterolemia, elevated Lp(a) where aggressive LDL lowering provides additional risk reduction, and patients with high calculated residual risk after addressing metabolic root causes. Where statins are overused is in low-risk primary prevention patients whose elevated LDL-C is driven by insulin resistance, hypothyroidism, or metabolic dysfunction that would respond to root-cause treatment. The question should never be "is your LDL high?" It should be "what is driving your LDL, what does your ApoB look like, and have we addressed the underlying cause first?"

### YOUR STANDARD LIPID PANEL ISN'T ENOUGH 

If your doctor has only tested total cholesterol and LDL-C, you don't know your real cardiovascular risk. An advanced lipid panel with ApoB, Lp(a), and metabolic markers gives you the full picture — and the data to make informed decisions.

### Estrogen Dominance: When Estrogen and Progesterone Fall Out of Balance
URL: https://moonshotmp.com/learn/estrogen-dominance/

← Back to Learn 

Women's Health 
## ESTROGEN DOMINANCE 

Estrogen dominance isn't about having too much estrogen. It's about the ratio between estrogen and progesterone being out of balance. Here's what actually drives it, how it affects your body, and what evidence-based treatment looks like. 
### WHAT ESTROGEN DOMINANCE ACTUALLY MEANS 

The term "estrogen dominance" gets thrown around loosely in wellness spaces, and the result is a lot of confusion. It does not necessarily mean you have too much estrogen. It means estrogen is dominant relative to progesterone. The ratio is what matters, not the absolute number. 

Estrogen and progesterone are meant to operate in balance. Estrogen promotes tissue growth — it thickens the uterine lining, stimulates breast tissue, increases fat storage, and promotes water retention. Progesterone opposes these effects: it stabilizes the uterine lining, reduces breast tissue proliferation, supports fat metabolism, and has a calming effect on the nervous system. When progesterone is insufficient to counterbalance estrogen's growth-promoting signals, estrogen's effects go unchecked. That's estrogen dominance. 

There are two distinct patterns, and understanding which one is driving your symptoms changes the treatment approach entirely: 
#### Pattern 1: Absolute Estrogen Excess 

Estrogen levels are genuinely elevated. This can result from excess body fat (adipose tissue produces estrogen via the aromatase enzyme), exposure to xenoestrogens (BPA, phthalates, parabens), impaired estrogen clearance through the liver and gut, or exogenous estrogen from oral contraceptives or conventional HRT. In this pattern, estradiol levels are measurably high on blood work, and the solution involves reducing estrogen production and improving estrogen metabolism and elimination. 
#### Pattern 2: Relative Estrogen Dominance 

Estrogen levels may be completely normal — or even low. But progesterone is even lower. This creates the same imbalance: estrogen is functionally unopposed. This is by far the more common pattern and the one most frequently missed. It is the hallmark of perimenopause (progesterone declines years before estrogen does), chronic stress (cortisol production steals progesterone precursors), and anovulatory cycles (no ovulation means no corpus luteum and minimal progesterone production). Estradiol on labs may look "fine" while the patient is profoundly symptomatic. 

**The takeaway: **If your provider only checks estradiol and tells you "your estrogen is normal," they've missed the point. Estrogen dominance is a ratio problem. You need estradiol and progesterone measured together — and in cycling women, progesterone must be drawn in the luteal phase (days 19-22) to be clinically meaningful. A random progesterone draw is almost useless. 
### SYMPTOMS OF ESTROGEN DOMINANCE 

Estrogen dominance affects nearly every system in the body because estrogen receptors are widely distributed — in the brain, breast, uterus, bone, liver, cardiovascular system, and adipose tissue. When the estrogen-to-progesterone ratio is skewed, the symptom list is broad and frequently attributed to "stress" or "getting older." 

Weight Gain (Hips, Thighs, Lower Abdomen) 

Estrogen promotes fat deposition in a gynoid pattern. Excess estrogen signaling increases lipoprotein lipase activity in hip and thigh adipocytes, making fat loss in these areas disproportionately difficult. 

Bloating & Water Retention 

Estrogen increases aldosterone sensitivity and promotes sodium and water retention. Cyclical bloating that worsens in the luteal phase is a classic sign of estrogen-progesterone imbalance. 

Breast Tenderness & Swelling 

Estrogen stimulates ductal proliferation in breast tissue. Without adequate progesterone to oppose this, breast tissue becomes swollen and painful, especially in the second half of the menstrual cycle. 

Heavy or Irregular Periods 

Unopposed estrogen thickens the endometrial lining excessively. Without sufficient progesterone to stabilize and regulate shedding, periods become heavy, prolonged, clotty, or irregularly timed. 

Mood Swings & Irritability 

Estrogen modulates serotonin, dopamine, and GABA activity. Progesterone's metabolite allopregnanolone is a potent GABA agonist with calming effects. When progesterone drops, you lose that neurological stabilizer. 

Severe PMS 

PMS is not inevitable. It's a signal that the estrogen-to-progesterone ratio in the luteal phase is off. Women with adequate progesterone levels relative to estrogen have significantly less premenstrual symptomatology. 

Anxiety & Insomnia 

Progesterone has anxiolytic and sedative properties through its action on GABA-A receptors. Low progesterone relative to estrogen removes this calming effect, contributing to anxiety, racing thoughts, and difficulty falling or staying asleep. 

Headaches & Migraines 

Estrogen fluctuations — particularly the drop in estrogen around menstruation — are a well-documented migraine trigger. Estrogen dominance creates wider hormonal swings, increasing headache frequency and severity. 

Fibroids & Endometriosis 

Uterine fibroids and endometriosis are estrogen-dependent conditions. Unopposed estrogen promotes the growth of both fibroids (leiomyomas) and endometrial implants. Managing the estrogen-progesterone ratio is foundational to managing these conditions. 

**The pattern to watch for: **Cyclical symptoms that worsen in the second half of the menstrual cycle (luteal phase), combined with heavy periods, weight gain concentrated in the lower body, and mood instability. If this cluster sounds familiar, the estrogen-to-progesterone ratio should be evaluated before attributing symptoms to stress or prescribing an SSRI. 
### ROOT CAUSES: WHY THE RATIO SHIFTS 

Estrogen dominance is a downstream consequence, not a root cause. Something is either increasing estrogen, decreasing progesterone, or impairing the body's ability to clear estrogen. Usually it's a combination. Here are the most common drivers we identify clinically: 
#### Perimenopause and Progesterone Decline 

This is the most common cause of relative estrogen dominance. Progesterone production depends on ovulation — specifically, the corpus luteum that forms after an egg is released. In perimenopause (which can begin in the late 30s), ovulation becomes inconsistent. Anovulatory cycles produce little to no progesterone, but the ovaries continue producing estrogen. The result: estrogen is now functionally unopposed. This is why perimenopausal women often experience their worst symptoms years before estrogen actually declines. It's not an estrogen problem. It's a progesterone problem. 
#### Chronic Stress and Pregnenolone Steal 

Pregnenolone is the precursor hormone from which both cortisol and progesterone are synthesized. Under chronic stress, the body preferentially shunts pregnenolone toward cortisol production at the expense of progesterone. This is sometimes called "pregnenolone steal" or "cortisol steal." The mechanism is straightforward: when survival is threatened (or the body perceives it is), stress hormones take priority over reproductive hormones. Chronic work stress, sleep deprivation , overtraining, and psychological strain all drive this pathway. Progesterone drops. The ratio shifts. Symptoms appear. 
#### Excess Body Fat and Aromatase Activity 

Adipose tissue is not metabolically inert. Fat cells express the aromatase enzyme (CYP19A1), which converts androgens — testosterone and androstenedione — into estrogens. The more body fat you carry, the more estrogen you produce peripherally, independent of ovarian production. This creates a vicious cycle: excess estrogen promotes further fat storage (particularly in estrogen-receptor-dense areas like hips and thighs), which produces more estrogen, which promotes more fat storage. This is why body composition optimization is a foundational intervention for estrogen dominance, not an afterthought. 
#### Xenoestrogens: Environmental Estrogen Mimics 

Xenoestrogens are synthetic compounds that bind to estrogen receptors and mimic estrogenic activity in the body. They are pervasive: BPA and BPS in plastics and receipt paper, phthalates in fragrances and personal care products, parabens in cosmetics and lotions, pesticides and herbicides on non-organic produce, and synthetic hormones in conventionally raised meat and dairy. These compounds are endocrine disruptors. They don't show up on standard estradiol blood tests because they aren't estradiol — but they activate the same receptors. Reducing xenoestrogen exposure is a meaningful lever, not a fringe concern. 
#### Gut Dysfunction and the Estrobolome 

The gut plays a critical role in estrogen clearance. After the liver conjugates estrogen for elimination (via glucuronidation), it's excreted into the bile and sent to the intestines for removal through stool. The estrobolome — a collection of gut bacteria that produce the enzyme beta-glucuronidase — can deconjugate estrogen, allowing it to be reabsorbed into circulation instead of eliminated. Gut dysbiosis (imbalanced gut flora) increases beta-glucuronidase activity, effectively recycling estrogen the body was trying to excrete. Constipation compounds the problem by increasing transit time and reabsorption opportunity. This is why gut health is not separate from hormone health — they are the same system. 
#### Oral Contraceptives 

Hormonal birth control suppresses the HPO (hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian) axis and prevents ovulation. Without ovulation, there is no corpus luteum and no significant endogenous progesterone production. Synthetic progestins in the pill are not biochemically identical to progesterone and do not provide the same metabolic, neurological, or protective effects. Women coming off oral contraceptives frequently experience a period of estrogen dominance as the body re-establishes its own hormone production — sometimes called "post-pill syndrome." The HPO axis can take months to fully recover. 
### ESTROGEN METABOLISM: HOW YOUR BODY PROCESSES AND CLEARS ESTROGEN 

Producing estrogen is only half the equation. The body must also metabolize and eliminate estrogen efficiently. When estrogen metabolism is impaired, even normal production levels can lead to estrogen dominance because the hormone accumulates instead of being cleared. Understanding the metabolism pathways matters because not all estrogen metabolites are created equal — some are protective, and some are potentially harmful. 

Phase 1: Hydroxylation (The Three Pathways) 

In the liver, estrogen is hydroxylated by cytochrome P450 enzymes into one of three metabolites. **2-hydroxyestrone (2-OH): **The preferred pathway. 2-OH metabolites have weak estrogenic activity and are considered protective. This is the pathway that DIM and cruciferous vegetables promote. **4-hydroxyestrone (4-OH): **The concerning pathway. 4-OH metabolites can generate reactive quinones that damage DNA through oxidative stress. Elevated 4-OH metabolites are associated with increased breast cancer risk in research models. This pathway is upregulated by inflammation and certain genetic polymorphisms (COMT). **16-alpha-hydroxyestrone (16-OH): **A potent estrogen metabolite with strong estrogenic activity. Elevated 16-OH is associated with increased tissue proliferation. The 2:16 ratio is a commonly assessed marker — a higher ratio (more 2-OH relative to 16-OH) is considered favorable. 

Phase 2: Conjugation (Making Estrogen Water-Soluble for Elimination) 

After hydroxylation, the liver must conjugate estrogen metabolites to make them water-soluble and ready for excretion. Three primary conjugation pathways are involved. **Glucuronidation: **Attaches glucuronic acid to estrogen metabolites. This is the primary elimination route. Calcium D-glucarate supports this pathway by inhibiting beta-glucuronidase, the enzyme that reverses glucuronidation in the gut. **Sulfation: **Attaches a sulfate group. Requires adequate sulfur amino acids (methionine, cysteine, taurine) and molybdenum. **Methylation: **Particularly important for neutralizing the potentially harmful 4-OH metabolites. The COMT (catechol-O-methyltransferase) enzyme methylates 4-OH estrogen into a safer form. This step requires adequate methylation capacity — B12, folate (as methylfolate), magnesium, and SAMe. Patients with COMT polymorphisms may have reduced methylation capacity and are more vulnerable to 4-OH accumulation. 

Phase 3: Elimination (Gut and Kidney Excretion) 

Conjugated estrogen is excreted via bile into the intestines (for elimination in stool) and via the kidneys (for elimination in urine). This is where gut health becomes directly relevant. If the gut microbiome is dysbiotic and beta-glucuronidase activity is elevated, conjugated estrogen gets deconjugated and reabsorbed — enterohepatic recirculation. The estrogen the liver just processed and packaged for removal gets recycled back into the bloodstream. Constipation makes this worse by increasing the window for reabsorption. Regular bowel movements, a diverse gut microbiome, and adequate fiber intake are not optional components of estrogen management — they are mechanistically necessary. 

**DIM, calcium D-glucarate, and cruciferous vegetables — what the evidence shows: **DIM (diindolylmethane) shifts estrogen metabolism toward the favorable 2-OH pathway. Research published in *Nutrition and Cancer *(2011) demonstrated this shift in postmenopausal women. Calcium D-glucarate inhibits beta-glucuronidase, supporting phase 2 glucuronidation and reducing enterohepatic recirculation of estrogen. Cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, kale) contain sulforaphane and indole-3-carbinol, which support both phase 1 and phase 2 liver detoxification. These are evidence-supported interventions, but they address specific steps in a multi-step process. A comprehensive approach requires addressing all three phases of estrogen metabolism, not just supplementing one compound. 
### ESTROGEN DOMINANCE BEYOND THE OBVIOUS 

Estrogen dominance doesn't exist in isolation. It interacts with other hormone systems in ways that create overlapping symptoms and compounding dysfunction. Two connections deserve specific attention because they are frequently overlooked. 
#### The Thyroid Connection 

Estrogen increases the liver's production of thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG). When TBG rises, more T4 and T3 get bound, reducing the free (bioavailable) thyroid hormone your cells can actually use. A woman with estrogen dominance may have total T4 and total T3 in range, but her free T4 and free T3 are suppressed. The result: hypothyroid symptoms — fatigue, weight gain, brain fog, cold intolerance, hair thinning — in a patient whose thyroid "looks normal" on standard testing. This is why thyroid optimization and estrogen balance must be assessed together. Treating one without evaluating the other produces incomplete results. Oral estrogen (birth control, oral HRT) amplifies this effect more than transdermal estrogen because oral forms undergo first-pass liver metabolism, directly stimulating TBG production. 
#### Estrogen Dominance in Men 

Estrogen dominance is not exclusively a female condition. Men produce estradiol primarily through the aromatase enzyme (CYP19A1), which converts testosterone to estradiol in adipose tissue, the liver, and the brain. Aromatase activity increases with higher body fat percentage, insulin resistance, alcohol consumption, and age. When estradiol rises relative to testosterone, men experience gynecomastia (breast tissue growth), increased abdominal and visceral fat, water retention, decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, and mood disturbances. In men on testosterone replacement therapy, managing estradiol conversion is a core component of the protocol — optimizing testosterone without managing aromatase activity leads to rising estradiol and symptom recurrence. Body composition is the single most impactful lever: reducing body fat reduces aromatase expression. 

**The systems view: **Estrogen doesn't operate on a single axis. It affects thyroid binding, insulin sensitivity, cortisol dynamics, and androgen metabolism. This is why isolated lab values — checking estradiol without progesterone, or thyroid without sex hormones — consistently fail to explain the clinical picture. Hormone optimization requires evaluating the entire endocrine network. 
### HOW WE TEST AND TREAT AT MOONSHOT 

Estrogen dominance isn't a diagnosis you guess at. It's a pattern you confirm with targeted testing and then address with a layered treatment protocol that targets the root causes — not just the symptoms. 

1. Comprehensive Testing 

We assess the full picture: **Estradiol (E2) **— serum levels to establish absolute estrogen status. **Progesterone **— drawn on days 19-22 of the menstrual cycle (luteal phase) in cycling women, or anytime in postmenopausal women. This timing is critical; a random draw is not clinically useful. **SHBG (sex hormone-binding globulin) **— low SHBG means more free estrogen is bioavailable and active. **Estrogen metabolites **— via DUTCH test or urinary metabolites panel, measuring 2-OH, 4-OH, and 16-OH pathways and the 2:16 ratio. **Comprehensive metabolic panel and liver function **— the liver is the primary organ for estrogen metabolism; impaired liver function impairs estrogen clearance. **Thyroid panel (TSH, Free T4, Free T3) **— to evaluate estrogen's impact on thyroid binding proteins. **Fasting insulin and inflammatory markers **— insulin resistance and systemic inflammation both exacerbate estrogen dominance. 

2. Progesterone Replacement (When Indicated) 

For relative estrogen dominance driven by low progesterone, bioidentical progesterone replacement is the most direct intervention. We use micronized bioidentical progesterone (oral or topical), which is structurally identical to what the body produces. This is distinct from synthetic progestins (medroxyprogesterone acetate, norethindrone), which have different receptor-binding profiles and a different risk profile. Bioidentical progesterone restores the estrogen-to-progesterone ratio, stabilizes the endometrial lining, reduces breast tenderness, supports sleep quality (via allopregnanolone's GABA activity), and helps regulate menstrual cyclicity. The Women's Health Initiative primarily studied synthetic progestins, not bioidentical progesterone — a distinction that matters for risk assessment. 

3. Liver and Gut Support 

Supporting estrogen metabolism requires optimizing the organs responsible for it. For the liver: cruciferous vegetables (sulforaphane), DIM, calcium D-glucarate, B vitamins (B6, B12, methylfolate), magnesium, and adequate protein intake to supply sulfur amino acids for conjugation. Limiting alcohol is critical — alcohol competes for the same liver detoxification pathways estrogen uses. For the gut: a high-fiber diet to support regular bowel movements, probiotics and prebiotics to promote a healthy estrobolome, and addressing any underlying dysbiosis, SIBO, or constipation. The goal is to ensure estrogen that the liver has processed for elimination actually gets eliminated. 

4. Body Composition Optimization 

Reducing excess body fat directly reduces peripheral estrogen production via aromatase. This is not about aesthetics — it's about reducing a measurable source of estrogen synthesis. Resistance training is particularly effective because it improves insulin sensitivity (insulin resistance upregulates aromatase), builds metabolically active tissue, and directly supports hormone balance. We approach body composition as a medical intervention, not a lifestyle suggestion. 

5. Reducing Xenoestrogen Exposure 

Practical steps that reduce estrogenic load: switch to glass or stainless steel food containers (eliminate BPA/BPS), use fragrance-free personal care products (eliminate phthalates), choose paraben-free skincare and cosmetics, filter drinking water (municipal water contains trace pharmaceuticals including synthetic estrogens), and prioritize organic produce for the Environmental Working Group's "Dirty Dozen" list. These are not extreme measures. They are evidence-based exposure reduction strategies that remove a contributing input to the estrogen dominance equation. 

6. Ongoing Monitoring 

We recheck labs 6-8 weeks after initiating treatment, then every 3-6 months once stable. Symptom tracking is equally important — labs and symptoms should move in the same direction. If they don't, we re-evaluate the treatment approach. Hormone optimization is iterative, not one-and-done. 
### COMMON QUESTIONS 
#### What is estrogen dominance? 

Estrogen dominance is a hormonal imbalance defined by the ratio of estrogen to progesterone, not just the absolute level of estrogen. It can occur in two ways: actual estrogen excess (too much estrogen being produced or not enough being cleared) or relative estrogen dominance (normal estrogen levels but low progesterone, making estrogen functionally unopposed). The second pattern is far more common and is the primary driver in perimenopause, chronic stress, and post-oral-contraceptive states. Symptoms include weight gain around the hips and thighs, bloating, breast tenderness, heavy or irregular periods, mood swings, PMS, anxiety, and headaches. 
#### Can men have estrogen dominance? 

Yes. Men produce estrogen through the aromatase enzyme, which converts testosterone to estradiol. Aromatase activity increases with higher body fat, alcohol consumption, insulin resistance, and certain medications. When estradiol rises relative to testosterone, men experience symptoms including gynecomastia (breast tissue development), increased abdominal fat, water retention, low libido, erectile dysfunction, and mood changes. Estrogen management is a core component of testosterone optimization in men — you cannot optimize testosterone without managing its conversion to estradiol. 
#### How do you test for estrogen dominance? 

Testing requires more than just an estradiol level. At Moonshot, we assess estradiol (E2), progesterone (timed to the luteal phase in cycling women), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), estrogen metabolites (2-OH, 4-OH, and 16-OH estrone via the DUTCH test or urinary metabolites panel), a comprehensive metabolic panel, liver function tests, and thyroid markers. The ratio of estradiol to progesterone in the luteal phase is the most clinically meaningful marker. Estrogen metabolite testing tells us whether estrogen is being processed through safe or potentially harmful pathways. 
#### Does DIM actually help with estrogen dominance? 

Diindolylmethane (DIM) is a compound derived from the digestion of indole-3-carbinol, found in cruciferous vegetables. Research shows DIM promotes the 2-hydroxylation pathway of estrogen metabolism, which produces the least biologically active metabolites. A 2011 study in *Nutrition and Cancer *showed DIM shifted estrogen metabolism toward 2-OHE1 in postmenopausal women. However, DIM alone is not a complete solution. It addresses one step in estrogen metabolism but does not fix progesterone deficiency, gut dysfunction, liver clearance issues, or xenoestrogen exposure. It's a useful tool within a comprehensive protocol, not a standalone fix. 
#### What is the connection between estrogen dominance and thyroid function? 

Estrogen directly increases the production of thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) in the liver. When TBG rises, more thyroid hormone gets bound and becomes biologically unavailable. This means a woman with estrogen dominance may have "normal" total thyroid hormone levels but reduced free T4 and free T3 — the forms her cells actually use. This is why estrogen dominance and hypothyroid symptoms frequently overlap: fatigue, weight gain, brain fog, cold intolerance. Treating thyroid without addressing estrogen dominance, or vice versa, often produces incomplete results. Both axes need to be evaluated together.

### SUSPECT ESTROGEN DOMINANCE? 

If your symptoms point to a hormone imbalance but your labs keep coming back "normal," you probably haven't had the right labs drawn. A comprehensive hormone panel — with properly timed progesterone and estrogen metabolite testing — gives you the full picture.

### Hashimoto's Thyroiditis: The Autoimmune Condition Behind Most Hypothyroidism
URL: https://moonshotmp.com/learn/hashimotos-thyroiditis/

← Back to Learn 

Thyroid & Autoimmune 
## HASHIMOTO'S THYROIDITIS 

The autoimmune condition behind most hypothyroidism. It affects up to 10% of the population, goes undiagnosed for years, and is almost never tested for in standard workups. Here's what it is, why it's missed, and what to do about it. 
### WHAT HASHIMOTO'S THYROIDITIS IS 

Hashimoto's thyroiditis is a chronic autoimmune disease in which the immune system produces antibodies that attack the thyroid gland. It is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in developed countries, responsible for an estimated 90% of all hypothyroid cases in iodine-sufficient populations. It was first described by Japanese physician Hakaru Hashimoto in 1912, and over a century later, it remains one of the most under-diagnosed conditions in medicine. 

The prevalence is significant: 5-10% of the general population has Hashimoto's, and it is 5-8 times more common in women than men. The peak onset is between ages 30 and 50, though it can present at any age, including adolescence. Many patients carry the condition for years — sometimes a decade or more — before it is identified, because the standard medical workup does not include the tests that detect it. 

In Hashimoto's, the immune system produces two primary types of antibodies: thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO antibodies) and thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb). Thyroid peroxidase is the enzyme the thyroid uses to produce hormones. Thyroglobulin is the protein scaffold used in hormone synthesis. Antibodies against these targets cause lymphocytic infiltration and gradual destruction of thyroid tissue. The gland becomes inflamed, fibrotic, and progressively less capable of producing adequate thyroid hormone. 

The result is hypothyroidism — but it's hypothyroidism with an autoimmune engine driving it. That distinction matters, because treating the hormone deficiency without addressing the autoimmune component is like mopping a floor while the faucet is still running. 

**The core problem: **Hashimoto's is not a thyroid disease. It is an immune system disease that happens to target the thyroid. The thyroid is the victim, not the cause. This reframe changes everything about how the condition should be evaluated and managed. 
### HOW HASHIMOTO'S PROGRESSES 

Hashimoto's is not a sudden event. It is a slow, progressive destruction that unfolds over years. Understanding the timeline is critical because it explains why the condition is caught so late and why early testing matters. 

Stage 1: Immune Activation (Antibodies Rise, Labs "Normal") 

The immune system begins producing TPO and/or thyroglobulin antibodies. The attack on thyroid tissue starts. But the gland has significant reserve capacity — it compensates by working harder. TSH, Free T4, and Free T3 remain within normal reference ranges. At this stage, a standard thyroid panel shows nothing wrong. Only antibody testing reveals the disease. This phase can last 5 to 10 years. 

Stage 2: Subclinical Hypothyroidism (TSH Starts to Climb) 

As more thyroid tissue is destroyed, the remaining gland can no longer fully compensate. The pituitary responds by increasing TSH output — pushing harder to squeeze more hormone from a damaged gland. TSH creeps upward (2.5-10 mIU/L) while Free T4 remains technically in range. Symptoms are present — fatigue, brain fog, weight gain — but the patient is told everything is "normal" because TSH hasn't crossed the arbitrary upper threshold. This is where the majority of Hashimoto's patients live for years, symptomatic and undiagnosed. 

Stage 3: Overt Hypothyroidism (Gland Failure) 

By the time TSH rises above the standard reference range (typically above 4.5-10 mIU/L) and Free T4 drops below range, 50-80% of functional thyroid tissue has already been destroyed. The damage is largely irreversible at this point. The patient now qualifies for a diagnosis and treatment — but the autoimmune process has been running unchecked for years. This is when most patients are finally diagnosed with Hashimoto's, if antibodies are tested at all. Many are simply labeled "hypothyroid" and given levothyroxine without ever identifying the autoimmune cause. 

Hashitoxicosis Episodes (The Confusing Part) 

During the progression, patients may experience transient episodes of hyperthyroidism — called Hashitoxicosis. As immune cells destroy thyroid follicles, stored thyroid hormone is released in bursts into the bloodstream. This causes temporary symptoms of hyperthyroidism: anxiety, heart palpitations, tremor, insomnia, heat intolerance, and weight loss. These episodes alternate with the baseline hypothyroid symptoms, creating a confusing clinical picture. Patients may be misdiagnosed with anxiety disorder, panic attacks, or even Graves' disease. The swinging pattern — hypo to hyper and back — is a hallmark of Hashimoto's and should prompt antibody testing. 

**Why this matters: **The conventional approach waits for Stage 3 — overt gland failure — before diagnosing and treating. By then, the damage is done. Antibody testing catches the disease at Stage 1, when the autoimmune process can be addressed and gland destruction can be slowed or reduced. The difference between testing antibodies early and waiting for TSH to rise is the difference between managing a fire and sifting through ashes. 
### WHY MOST CASES ARE MISSED 

The diagnosis gap in Hashimoto's is not a mystery. It's a structural failure in how thyroid disease is screened. Here's exactly why it happens: 
#### Antibodies Aren't Tested 

The standard thyroid screening is TSH only. Some panels add Free T4. Almost none include TPO antibodies or thyroglobulin antibodies. Without antibody testing, Hashimoto's is invisible until the gland has sustained enough damage to move TSH out of range. This is the single biggest reason the condition is missed. 
#### TSH Reference Ranges Are Too Wide 

The upper limit of "normal" for TSH is 4.5 mIU/L at most labs. A patient with Hashimoto's whose TSH has risen from 1.0 to 3.8 over three years is experiencing a significant decline in thyroid function — but will be told everything is normal. The National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry has recommended narrowing the upper limit to 2.5 mIU/L. Most labs and practitioners have not adopted this. 
#### Symptoms Are Attributed to Other Causes 

Fatigue, weight gain, brain fog, depression, hair loss — these are the symptoms of Hashimoto's, and they are routinely attributed to stress, aging, poor sleep, or mental health conditions. Patients are prescribed antidepressants, sleep aids, or told to exercise more, when the underlying cause is an autoimmune process destroying their thyroid. 
#### The "Wait and Watch" Approach 

Even when antibodies are tested and found elevated, some practitioners take a passive approach: "Your antibodies are elevated, but your TSH is normal, so we'll just monitor." This means watching the gland be destroyed and intervening only after irreversible damage. It's the medical equivalent of diagnosing termites and waiting until the house collapses before treating. 
#### Fluctuating Symptoms Cause Confusion 

The Hashitoxicosis episodes described above — where patients swing between hypo and hyper symptoms — create a confusing picture. One month the patient reports fatigue and weight gain; the next, anxiety and heart palpitations. This inconsistency leads to misdiagnosis (anxiety disorder, perimenopause, fibromyalgia) rather than the correct workup. 
#### Gender Bias in Symptom Evaluation 

Hashimoto's is 5-8 times more common in women, and the symptoms — fatigue, mood changes, weight gain, hair loss — overlap heavily with complaints that are frequently minimized in female patients. Research published in the *New England Journal of Medicine *has documented gender disparities in diagnostic workups for fatigue and mood symptoms. Women with Hashimoto's are disproportionately likely to be told "it's just stress" without appropriate lab testing. 

**The bottom line: **If you have symptoms consistent with hypothyroidism and your doctor has only tested TSH, you have not been adequately screened. A complete evaluation requires TPO antibodies and thyroglobulin antibodies at minimum. Without those, Hashimoto's cannot be ruled out. 
### SYMPTOMS OF HASHIMOTO'S THYROIDITIS 

The symptoms of Hashimoto's are the symptoms of hypothyroidism — because Hashimoto's is the autoimmune process that causes the hypothyroidism. But there are features specific to the autoimmune component that distinguish Hashimoto's from other causes of low thyroid function. 

Hypothyroid Symptoms (From Declining Thyroid Output) 

Fatigue 

Persistent, unrelenting exhaustion that sleep doesn't fix. Driven by reduced cellular energy production from low T3. 

Weight Gain 

Unexplained weight gain or inability to lose weight despite consistent effort. Metabolic rate slows as thyroid output declines. 

Brain Fog 

Poor concentration, memory lapses, slowed cognitive processing. T3 directly regulates cerebral blood flow and neurotransmitter synthesis. 

Hair Loss 

Diffuse hair thinning, loss of outer third of eyebrows, dry brittle hair. Thyroid hormones regulate the hair growth cycle. 

Cold Intolerance 

Always cold, cold hands and feet. T3 drives thermogenesis. Low output means reduced heat production at the cellular level. 

Constipation 

Slowed gut motility from reduced T3 activity on smooth muscle. Often attributed to diet when thyroid is the actual driver. 

Depression 

Low mood, anhedonia, or clinical depression. T3 modulates serotonin receptor sensitivity. Many patients are prescribed antidepressants when thyroid is the root cause. 

Dry Skin 

Rough, flaky, dry skin — particularly shins, elbows, and hands. Reduced keratinocyte turnover and decreased sebum production. 

Menstrual Irregularity 

Heavy, irregular, or absent periods. Hypothyroidism disrupts the HPG axis and impairs progesterone production. A common cause of fertility issues. 

Hashimoto's-Specific Symptoms (From the Autoimmune Process) 

Symptom Fluctuation (Hypo/Hyper Swings) 

Weeks of fatigue and sluggishness followed by episodes of anxiety, rapid heart rate, and insomnia. As immune destruction damages thyroid follicles, stored hormone is released in bursts. This back-and-forth pattern is characteristic of Hashimoto's and frequently misdiagnosed. 

Anxiety & Palpitations (Hashitoxicosis) 

During hormone dump episodes, patients experience hyperthyroid symptoms: anxiety, heart palpitations, tremor, heat intolerance, insomnia. These episodes are transient, lasting days to weeks, then resolve back to a hypothyroid baseline. Often misdiagnosed as panic disorder or generalized anxiety. 

Throat Pressure or Fullness 

A sensation of pressure, fullness, or difficulty swallowing. The thyroid gland may enlarge (goiter) or develop a nodular texture due to chronic inflammation and fibrosis from the autoimmune process. 

Joint and Muscle Pain 

Generalized aches, stiffness, and pain — particularly in the morning. The systemic inflammatory component of Hashimoto's can produce musculoskeletal symptoms beyond what hypothyroidism alone causes. Patients are sometimes misdiagnosed with fibromyalgia. 

**The distinguishing feature: **If your symptoms fluctuate — periods of hypothyroid fatigue alternating with bursts of anxiety and palpitations — that pattern is strongly suggestive of Hashimoto's and warrants antibody testing. Stable hypothyroidism doesn't swing. Autoimmune hypothyroidism does. 
### TRIGGERS AND DRIVERS OF HASHIMOTO'S 

Hashimoto's has a genetic predisposition — certain HLA gene variants increase susceptibility — but genetics load the gun; environment pulls the trigger. The autoimmune process requires both genetic susceptibility and environmental triggers. Identifying and addressing these triggers is where the real opportunity lies, because while you can't change your genes, you can modify the environmental inputs that activate and sustain the autoimmune attack. 
#### Intestinal Permeability ("Leaky Gut") 

Dr. Alessio Fasano's research at Harvard has demonstrated that intestinal permeability is a prerequisite for autoimmune disease development — not just a consequence. When the gut barrier is compromised, large protein fragments pass into the bloodstream, triggering immune activation. In genetically susceptible individuals, this immune response can cross-react with self-tissues, including the thyroid. Restoring gut barrier integrity is a foundational intervention in managing Hashimoto's. Fasano's triad — genetic susceptibility, environmental trigger, and intestinal permeability — is the current model for autoimmune disease pathogenesis. 
#### Gluten and Molecular Mimicry 

Gliadin — the protein fraction in wheat gluten — has a molecular structure that closely resembles thyroid peroxidase (TPO). This is molecular mimicry: the immune system mounts a response against gliadin, and because TPO looks structurally similar, it attacks the thyroid as collateral damage. Additionally, gliadin triggers the release of zonulin, a protein that regulates tight junctions in the intestinal lining. Elevated zonulin increases intestinal permeability, compounding the immune trigger. This creates a reinforcing loop: gluten damages the gut barrier, which increases immune activation, which amplifies the autoimmune attack on the thyroid. The gluten-Hashimoto's connection is discussed in detail below. 
#### Selenium Deficiency 

Selenium is a critical cofactor for thyroid function. The thyroid contains more selenium per gram of tissue than any other organ in the body. Selenium is required for the deiodinase enzymes that convert T4 to T3, and for glutathione peroxidase, which protects the thyroid from oxidative damage during hormone production. Selenium deficiency is associated with higher TPO antibody levels, and supplementation with 200mcg of selenomethionine has been shown to significantly reduce TPO antibodies in multiple randomized controlled trials (Toulis 2010, van Zuuren 2013). 
#### Vitamin D Deficiency 

Vitamin D functions as an immunomodulator, regulating both innate and adaptive immune responses. Multiple studies have found that Hashimoto's patients have significantly lower vitamin D levels compared to healthy controls, and that low vitamin D is correlated with higher antibody levels and greater disease severity. A meta-analysis by Wang et al. (2015) in the *International Journal of Endocrinology *confirmed the association between vitamin D deficiency and autoimmune thyroid disease. Optimization of vitamin D to 50-80 ng/mL is a standard part of autoimmune thyroid management. 
#### Chronic Stress and HPA Axis Dysregulation 

Chronic psychological and physiological stress elevates cortisol, which suppresses TSH secretion, impairs T4-to-T3 conversion , increases Reverse T3, and shifts the immune system toward a Th1-dominant inflammatory profile. Sustained stress also increases intestinal permeability via cortisol's effect on tight junction proteins. The stress-gut-immune-thyroid axis is a well-documented feedback loop, and stress management is not optional in Hashimoto's — it's a treatment variable. 
#### Pregnancy and Postpartum 

Pregnancy is one of the most common triggers for Hashimoto's onset. During pregnancy, the immune system downregulates to tolerate the fetus. After delivery, the immune system rebounds — often aggressively — and in genetically susceptible women, this rebound triggers autoimmune thyroiditis. Postpartum thyroiditis affects 5-10% of women and progresses to permanent Hashimoto's in approximately 20-30% of cases. Many women attribute postpartum fatigue, weight retention, mood changes, and hair loss to "normal postpartum recovery" when Hashimoto's is the actual driver. 
#### Viral Triggers (EBV and Others) 

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the virus that causes mononucleosis, has been strongly associated with autoimmune thyroid disease. EBV can infect thyroid cells directly and trigger molecular mimicry responses. Other viral triggers include hepatitis C, parvovirus B19, and HTLV-1. A history of viral illness — particularly EBV — in a patient with thyroid symptoms should prompt antibody testing. Vojdani et al. (2014) published data showing that EBV antibodies cross-react with thyroid antigens, providing a mechanistic explanation for the viral trigger pathway. 
### THE GLUTEN-HASHIMOTO'S CONNECTION 

The relationship between gluten and Hashimoto's deserves dedicated attention because it is one of the most actionable and evidence-supported interventions for reducing autoimmune thyroid activity. This is not about general "gluten sensitivity" trends. It's about a specific immunological mechanism with published data behind it. 

Molecular Mimicry 

Gliadin, the prolamin protein in wheat, has amino acid sequences that are structurally similar to thyroid peroxidase (TPO). When gliadin enters the bloodstream — particularly through a permeable gut barrier — the immune system produces antibodies against it. Due to the structural similarity, these antibodies cross-react with TPO on thyroid cells. The immune system cannot distinguish between the foreign protein and the self-tissue. This is molecular mimicry, and it is a well-established mechanism in autoimmune disease pathogenesis. 

Zonulin and Intestinal Permeability 

Gliadin triggers the release of zonulin in the intestinal epithelium, regardless of whether the individual has celiac disease. Zonulin opens tight junctions between intestinal cells, increasing permeability. This allows larger protein fragments — including gliadin itself — to enter the bloodstream and activate immune responses. In Hashimoto's patients, this pathway is particularly relevant because increased intestinal permeability has been demonstrated to precede and sustain autoimmune activity. Fasano's research has shown that zonulin is elevated in multiple autoimmune conditions, with gliadin being one of the most potent dietary triggers. 

The Evidence for Gluten-Free Diet 

Multiple studies have demonstrated that strict gluten-free diets reduce thyroid antibody levels in Hashimoto's patients. Krysiak et al. (2018) published a study showing that women with Hashimoto's who followed a gluten-free diet for six months experienced significant reductions in both TPO and thyroglobulin antibodies compared to controls who maintained a normal diet. A separate study by Virili et al. (2018) showed that gluten-free diet improved thyroid function and reduced the required dose of levothyroxine in Hashimoto's patients with concurrent non-celiac gluten sensitivity. The effect is not universal — not every Hashimoto's patient will respond — but the intervention is low-risk and the potential benefit is meaningful. 

Hashimoto's and Celiac Disease Overlap 

The co-occurrence of Hashimoto's and celiac disease is well above what chance alone would predict. Patients with celiac disease have a 2-5x higher prevalence of autoimmune thyroid disease compared to the general population. This supports a shared immunological pathway. Even in Hashimoto's patients who do not meet criteria for celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity can drive intestinal permeability and immune activation sufficient to sustain the autoimmune attack on the thyroid. 

**Practical takeaway: **A strict gluten-free trial of 3-6 months is a reasonable, low-risk intervention for any Hashimoto's patient. The endpoint is not subjective feelings about gluten — it's measurable antibody reduction on repeat lab testing. If antibodies decrease significantly, the data supports continued elimination. If not, the intervention can be discontinued. This is data-driven, not ideology-driven. 
### TESTING AND DIAGNOSIS 

A proper Hashimoto's evaluation requires more than a thyroid panel. Because the condition is autoimmune and driven by environmental triggers, the workup needs to assess the immune component, thyroid function, and the cofactors that influence both. Here's what a complete evaluation includes: Test What It Tells You Why It Matters TPO Antibodies Whether the immune system is attacking thyroid peroxidase The primary diagnostic marker for Hashimoto's. Elevated in ~90% of cases. Thyroglobulin Antibodies Whether the immune system is attacking thyroglobulin Elevated in ~60-80% of Hashimoto's cases. Some patients are TgAb-positive but TPO-negative. Test both. TSH Pituitary signal to the thyroid Indicates how hard the brain is pushing the thyroid. May be "normal" for years in early Hashimoto's. Free T4 & Free T3 Actual circulating thyroid hormone levels Shows current thyroid output and conversion. Free T3 is the active hormone your cells use. Reverse T3 Inactive T3 metabolite that blocks receptors Often elevated in Hashimoto's due to inflammation. Creates functional hypothyroidism even with "normal" Free T3. Vitamin D (25-OH) Vitamin D status Deficiency is strongly correlated with higher antibody levels and autoimmune disease severity. Selenium Selenium status Critical for thyroid enzyme function and immune modulation. Supplementation reduces TPO antibodies. Iron / Ferritin Iron stores and availability Iron is required for thyroid peroxidase function. Deficiency impairs thyroid hormone synthesis directly. hs-CRP Systemic inflammation marker Elevated inflammation drives autoimmune activity and impairs T4-to-T3 conversion. Thyroid Ultrasound Structural imaging of the gland Shows heterogeneous texture, nodules, or reduced vascularity characteristic of Hashimoto's. Can detect changes before antibodies are conclusively elevated. 

**The standard workup vs. the real workup: **A conventional thyroid screen gives you TSH and maybe Free T4 — two data points that miss the autoimmune component entirely. The evaluation above gives you the complete picture: is the immune system attacking, how much function remains, what's driving the attack, and what cofactors are deficient. You cannot manage what you have not measured. 
### CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT VS. OPTIMIZATION APPROACH 

The conventional approach to Hashimoto's is straightforward: wait until TSH rises out of range, then prescribe levothyroxine. That's it. The autoimmune component is acknowledged diagnostically but not treated. Antibody levels are not monitored as a treatment target. Triggers are not investigated. Cofactors are not assessed. The immune system continues to attack the gland while the patient takes a pill to replace what the gland can no longer produce. 

This approach manages the downstream consequence (hormone deficiency) while ignoring the upstream cause (immune dysregulation). It is necessary — hormone replacement is often required — but it is not sufficient. 

Conventional Approach 

- - Test TSH (and maybe Free T4) 
- - Wait until TSH rises above reference range 
- - Prescribe levothyroxine (synthetic T4) 
- - Titrate dose to normalize TSH 
- - Recheck TSH annually 
- - No antibody monitoring 
- - No trigger investigation 
- - No cofactor assessment 

Optimization Approach 

- - Full thyroid panel + antibodies + cofactors 
- - Intervene when antibodies are elevated, even with "normal" TSH 
- - Address the autoimmune driver: gut health, trigger removal, immune modulation 
- - Optimize micronutrients: selenium (200mcg), vitamin D (50-80 ng/mL), iron 
- - Thyroid hormone replacement when clinically indicated 
- - Consider combination T4/T3 therapy if conversion is impaired 
- - Monitor antibody trends as a treatment target 
- - Identify and eliminate environmental triggers 

Selenium Supplementation 

One of the most well-supported interventions. A meta-analysis by Toulis et al. (2010) in *Thyroid *and a Cochrane review by van Zuuren et al. (2013) both confirmed that 200mcg of selenomethionine daily significantly reduces TPO antibody levels in Hashimoto's patients. The mechanism: selenium is required for glutathione peroxidase, which neutralizes the hydrogen peroxide generated during thyroid hormone synthesis. Without adequate selenium, this oxidative stress damages thyroid cells and amplifies the immune response. Selenium supplementation reduces oxidative damage and, consequently, the autoimmune stimulus. 

Vitamin D Optimization 

Vitamin D regulates T-regulatory cells — the immune cells responsible for preventing autoimmune reactions. Low vitamin D is consistently associated with higher Hashimoto's antibody levels and disease severity. The target for autoimmune thyroid patients is 50-80 ng/mL (25-OH vitamin D), which is well above the conventional "sufficient" threshold of 30 ng/mL. Achieving this typically requires supplementation with vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) at doses of 4,000-10,000 IU daily, with monitoring to ensure target levels and avoid toxicity. 

Gut Health Restoration 

Given the role of intestinal permeability in autoimmune disease initiation and maintenance, restoring gut barrier integrity is a foundational intervention. This includes identifying and removing dietary triggers (gluten being the most evidence-supported), addressing dysbiosis, supporting the microbiome, and reducing systemic inflammation. The gut is not a peripheral concern in Hashimoto's — it is mechanistically central to the disease process. 

Thyroid Hormone Replacement 

When thyroid output is insufficient — as measured by Free T4, Free T3, and clinical symptoms — hormone replacement is appropriate and necessary. Options include levothyroxine (synthetic T4), liothyronine (synthetic T3), combination T4/T3 therapy, or desiccated thyroid (Armour, NP Thyroid). The choice depends on the patient's conversion capacity, symptom response, and lab results. In Hashimoto's patients with impaired T4-to-T3 conversion, T4-only therapy may be inadequate, and combination therapy or direct T3 supplementation often produces better clinical outcomes. 

**The difference in philosophy: **Conventional medicine treats Hashimoto's as a thyroid disease and replaces what the thyroid can no longer produce. The optimization approach treats it as an immune system disease, addresses the drivers of the autoimmune attack, restores the cofactors the thyroid needs, and replaces hormone when necessary. One manages the consequence. The other addresses the cause. Both are needed — but the cause must not be ignored. 
### COMMON QUESTIONS 
#### What is the difference between Hashimoto's and hypothyroidism? 

Hypothyroidism is a condition — your thyroid isn't producing enough hormone. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is a cause of that condition — specifically, an autoimmune disease where your immune system produces antibodies that attack and gradually destroy thyroid tissue. Hashimoto's is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in developed countries, responsible for roughly 90% of cases. The distinction matters because treating Hashimoto's as "just hypothyroidism" means you only address the hormone deficiency with levothyroxine while ignoring the autoimmune process that's driving the destruction. Addressing the autoimmune component — through trigger identification, gut health, micronutrient optimization, and immune modulation — can slow or reduce the attack on the gland itself. 
#### Can you have Hashimoto's with normal TSH levels? 

Yes — and this is exactly why most cases are missed for years. Hashimoto's is an autoimmune disease, not a thyroid hormone disease. The autoimmune attack begins long before thyroid hormone levels change. TPO and thyroglobulin antibodies can be elevated for 5 to 10 years before TSH rises out of range. During that time, the immune system is actively destroying thyroid tissue, but the remaining healthy tissue compensates by working harder. TSH stays "normal" because the gland is keeping up — until it can't. By the time TSH finally rises, 50 to 80 percent of functional thyroid tissue may already be destroyed. This is why antibody testing is essential: it catches the disease in its early, treatable phase rather than after irreversible damage has occurred. 
#### Does gluten really affect Hashimoto's? 

The connection is well-documented. Gliadin — the protein fraction in gluten — has a molecular structure that resembles thyroid peroxidase (TPO), the enzyme your thyroid uses to produce hormones. This is called molecular mimicry: the immune system attacks gliadin, and because TPO looks similar, it cross-reacts and attacks the thyroid as well. Gluten also triggers zonulin release in the gut, which increases intestinal permeability, allowing larger protein fragments into the bloodstream and amplifying immune activation. Multiple studies have shown that strict gluten-free diets reduce TPO antibody levels in Hashimoto's patients. A 2018 study by Krysiak et al. found significant reductions in both TPO and thyroglobulin antibodies after six months of gluten elimination. It's not a cure, but for many Hashimoto's patients, it meaningfully reduces the autoimmune burden on the thyroid. 
#### What labs should I ask for if I suspect Hashimoto's? 

At minimum, you need TPO antibodies and thyroglobulin antibodies — these are the two markers that diagnose Hashimoto's, and they're almost never included in standard thyroid panels. Beyond that, a complete workup should include: TSH, Free T4, Free T3, and Reverse T3 (full thyroid panel), vitamin D (deficiency is strongly associated with autoimmune thyroid disease), selenium (critical for thyroid function and immune modulation), iron and ferritin (iron deficiency impairs thyroid hormone production), and inflammatory markers like hs-CRP. A thyroid ultrasound is also valuable — it can show characteristic changes in thyroid texture and size even when antibody levels are borderline. Many patients with Hashimoto's are diagnosed on ultrasound before antibodies are conclusively elevated. 
#### Can Hashimoto's be reversed or cured? 

Hashimoto's is a chronic autoimmune condition — there is no definitive cure in the conventional sense. However, the autoimmune activity can be significantly reduced, and in some cases antibody levels can normalize. The goal is to reduce the immune system's attack on the thyroid, slow or halt tissue destruction, and optimize thyroid function. This is achieved through identifying and removing triggers (gluten, other food sensitivities, environmental toxins), restoring gut barrier integrity, correcting micronutrient deficiencies (especially selenium, vitamin D, and iron), managing stress, and using thyroid hormone replacement when needed. Many patients who adopt a comprehensive approach see substantial reductions in antibody levels and improvement in symptoms. The earlier you intervene — ideally before significant gland destruction — the better the outcomes.

### Sleep Optimization: The Foundation Your Hormones Are Built On
URL: https://moonshotmp.com/learn/sleep-optimization/

← Back to Learn 

Performance & Recovery 
## SLEEP OPTIMIZATION 

Sleep is the single most powerful lever for hormone optimization. Testosterone, growth hormone, cortisol, and insulin sensitivity all depend on it. Before you optimize anything else, fix the foundation. 
### WHY SLEEP IS THE #1 LEVER FOR HORMONE OPTIMIZATION 

Every major hormone in your body is regulated by sleep. Not influenced. Not loosely correlated. Regulated. Testosterone, growth hormone, cortisol, insulin, leptin, ghrelin, thyroid hormones — all of them depend on adequate sleep duration, sleep quality, and consistent sleep timing to function properly. 

This is not a soft recommendation. The endocrine system runs on circadian rhythms, and sleep is the master synchronizer of those rhythms. When sleep breaks down, the entire hormonal cascade breaks down with it. No supplement, injection, or protocol can fully compensate for chronic sleep deprivation. You cannot out-optimize bad sleep. 

Here is what sleep directly controls: 
#### Testosterone Production 

The majority of daily testosterone release occurs during sleep, particularly during the first REM cycle and deep sleep phases. Sleep restriction directly and measurably suppresses testosterone output. No amount of training volume or dietary optimization overrides this. 
#### Growth Hormone Secretion 

Approximately 70% of daily growth hormone secretion occurs during deep sleep (slow-wave sleep), with the largest pulse occurring in the first 90 minutes after sleep onset. Disrupt deep sleep and you lose the primary stimulus for tissue repair, recovery, and body composition. 
#### Cortisol Regulation 

Cortisol follows a diurnal rhythm: high in the morning to drive wakefulness, declining through the day, lowest at night. Sleep deprivation elevates evening cortisol by up to 37%, flattening this curve. Chronically elevated cortisol drives muscle breakdown, fat storage (especially visceral), insulin resistance, and immune suppression. 
#### Insulin Sensitivity 

Even partial sleep deprivation — one week of 5-hour nights — measurably impairs glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Your cells become less responsive to insulin, blood sugar rises, and the body shifts toward fat storage. Sleep is a metabolic intervention, not just a recovery tool. 

**The takeaway: **If you are pursuing hormone optimization — whether through TRT, peptides, lifestyle changes, or any other intervention — and you are not sleeping well, you are building on a cracked foundation. Sleep is not a "nice to have." It is the single highest-ROI input for endocrine function. 
### SLEEP ARCHITECTURE: WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU SLEEP 

Sleep is not a uniform state. It is a highly structured process that cycles through distinct stages, each serving different biological functions. A typical night includes 4 to 6 cycles of approximately 90 minutes each, alternating between non-REM (NREM) and REM sleep. The composition of these cycles changes throughout the night — deep sleep is concentrated in the first half, REM sleep in the second half. This is why both falling asleep on time and sleeping long enough matter. 

Stage 1 NREM (N1) — Light Sleep 

The transition between wakefulness and sleep. Lasts 1 to 5 minutes. Muscle activity slows, eyes drift. You can be easily awakened. This stage is brief and serves primarily as a gateway into deeper stages. Not where the meaningful work happens. 

Stage 2 NREM (N2) — Intermediate Sleep 

Accounts for about 50% of total sleep time. Heart rate and body temperature drop. Sleep spindles and K-complexes appear on EEG — these are associated with memory consolidation and synaptic maintenance. This is a functional stage, but the heavy lifting for hormone secretion and physical recovery happens in the next stage. 

Stage 3 NREM (N3) — Deep Sleep / Slow-Wave Sleep 

This is the stage that matters most for physical recovery and hormone production. Delta brainwaves dominate. Growth hormone is released in large pulses. Tissue repair, muscle protein synthesis, and immune function are at their peak. Blood pressure drops, blood flow to muscles increases. Deep sleep is concentrated in the first 3 to 4 hours of the night, which is why going to bed late and waking up at the same time — even if total hours are adequate — can still result in insufficient deep sleep. You cannot make up for lost deep sleep later in the night. 

REM Sleep — Rapid Eye Movement 

REM sleep is where the brain does its critical work: emotional processing, memory consolidation, learning integration, and creative problem-solving. Brain activity during REM is nearly identical to wakefulness. REM cycles lengthen through the night — the longest REM periods occur in the final 2 to 3 hours of sleep. This is why cutting sleep short by even 60 to 90 minutes disproportionately eliminates REM sleep, with consequences for mood regulation, cognitive function, and emotional resilience. Alcohol, cannabis, and many sleep medications suppress REM, which is why "sleeping" 8 hours under their influence does not produce the same recovery as natural sleep. 

**Why this matters clinically: **When patients report sleeping 7 to 8 hours but still feeling unrested, the issue is almost always sleep architecture — they are getting the hours but not the right composition of stages. Sleep apnea fragments deep sleep. Alcohol suppresses REM. Late bedtimes reduce the deep sleep window. Screen exposure delays sleep onset and compresses the entire cycle. Total hours in bed is a crude measure. What matters is the quality and completeness of the stages within those hours. 
### HOW POOR SLEEP TANKS TESTOSTERONE 

The relationship between sleep and testosterone is not theoretical. It is one of the most well-documented dose-response relationships in endocrinology. 

A landmark study by Leproult and Van Cauter, published in JAMA in 2011, demonstrated that restricting healthy young men to 5 hours of sleep per night for just one week reduced their testosterone levels by 10 to 15%. To put that in perspective: that is the equivalent of 10 to 15 years of aging. In one week. The subjects reported decreased vigor and increased fatigue — symptoms that mirror clinical hypogonadism. And these were young, healthy men with no prior hormonal issues. 

Testosterone production is pulsatile and follows a circadian rhythm. Levels begin rising at sleep onset, peak during the first REM cycle (typically 60 to 90 minutes into sleep), and continue pulsing through the night. Morning testosterone — the value measured on standard lab work — reflects the cumulative output of the prior night's sleep. Shorter sleep, fragmented sleep, or delayed sleep onset all result in lower morning testosterone. 

The hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, which drives testosterone production, is sensitive to both sleep duration and sleep quality. Sleep fragmentation — as seen in obstructive sleep apnea — suppresses LH (luteinizing hormone) pulsatility even when total sleep time appears adequate. This means you can be in bed for 8 hours but producing testosterone like someone who slept 5 if your sleep is fragmented by apneas or arousals. 

10-15% Testosterone Drop 

One week of 5-hour sleep nights in healthy young men. Equivalent to 10-15 years of age-related decline. (Leproult & Van Cauter, 2011) 

Sleep Apnea Connection 

Men with untreated obstructive sleep apnea have significantly lower testosterone levels. CPAP treatment has been shown to partially restore testosterone production. (Luboshitzky et al., 2002) 

Every Hour Counts 

Population studies show a near-linear relationship: each additional hour of sleep is associated with approximately 15% higher testosterone levels, up to about 8 hours. (Penev, 2007) 

**The clinical implication: **If a patient presents with low testosterone symptoms and we find suboptimal levels on labs, the first question is not "should we start TRT?" The first question is "how is your sleep?" Prescribing testosterone replacement while ignoring a 5-hour sleep habit or undiagnosed sleep apnea is treating a symptom while leaving the cause in place. Fix the foundation first. If levels are still suboptimal after sleep is addressed, then we have a real baseline to work from. 
### GROWTH HORMONE, CORTISOL, AND INSULIN: THE SLEEP-DEPENDENT TRIAD 

Testosterone gets the headlines, but three other hormonal systems are equally dependent on sleep — and equally disrupted when sleep fails. Together, these form the metabolic and recovery backbone that determines your body composition, energy, and resilience. 

Growth Hormone (GH) 

Approximately 70% of daily growth hormone secretion occurs during deep sleep (slow-wave sleep), with the largest GH pulse occurring within the first 90 minutes of sleep onset. GH drives tissue repair, muscle protein synthesis, fat metabolism, and cellular regeneration. It is the primary recovery hormone. Anything that reduces deep sleep — alcohol, sleep apnea, late bedtimes, aging — directly reduces GH output. This is why patients who sleep poorly often report slow recovery from training, persistent injuries, and difficulty building or maintaining muscle mass. The peptide protocols many clinics offer to boost GH are working against a headwind if the patient's deep sleep is compromised. 

Cortisol 

Cortisol follows a predictable diurnal rhythm: it peaks in the early morning (the cortisol awakening response) to drive alertness and energy, then declines steadily through the day, reaching its lowest point around midnight. This rhythm is essential. Sleep deprivation disrupts it. Studies show that even one night of restricted sleep (4 hours) elevates evening cortisol levels by 37% the following day (Leproult et al., 1997). Chronic sleep restriction flattens the diurnal cortisol curve — meaning cortisol stays elevated when it should be low. The downstream effects: increased visceral fat storage, muscle protein breakdown, impaired immune function, elevated blood pressure, insulin resistance, and suppressed testosterone production. Cortisol and testosterone are inversely related — when cortisol is chronically elevated, testosterone drops. This is the HPA axis overriding the HPG axis, and it is one of the most common endocrine patterns we see in high-stress, under-sleeping patients. 

Insulin Sensitivity 

Sleep restriction impairs glucose metabolism rapidly and profoundly. A study by Spiegel et al. (1999) in The Lancet showed that restricting healthy young men to 4 hours of sleep for 6 nights reduced their glucose tolerance to a level comparable to pre-diabetes. Insulin sensitivity dropped by 40%. The body's ability to clear glucose from the blood was severely impaired — after less than a week. A 2010 study by Nedeltcheva et al. in the Annals of Internal Medicine demonstrated that when subjects were placed on a calorie-restricted diet, those sleeping 5.5 hours per night lost 55% more lean mass and 60% less fat compared to those sleeping 8.5 hours — same calorie deficit, dramatically different body composition outcomes. Sleep deprivation doesn't just make you tired. It fundamentally shifts your metabolism toward muscle loss and fat retention. 

**The compound effect: **These three systems do not fail independently. When sleep is restricted, GH drops (reducing recovery and muscle maintenance), cortisol rises (promoting fat storage and muscle breakdown), and insulin sensitivity deteriorates (impairing glucose metabolism and nutrient partitioning). This is a simultaneous, multi-axis endocrine failure triggered by a single variable. No supplement stack, training program, or dietary intervention can outrun it. The fix is sleep. 
### SLEEP AND BODY COMPOSITION 

If your goal involves fat loss, muscle gain, or body recomposition, sleep is not optional. It is the variable that determines whether your calorie deficit burns fat or muscle, whether your training stimulus builds tissue or breaks it down, and whether your metabolism works for you or against you. 

The Nedeltcheva et al. (2010) study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine is one of the most striking demonstrations of this. Two groups of overweight adults were placed on identical calorie-restricted diets. One group slept 8.5 hours per night. The other slept 5.5 hours. The results: 
#### 8.5 Hours of Sleep 

Subjects lost a balanced ratio of fat and lean mass. Fat accounted for approximately 50% of total weight lost. Resting metabolic rate was preserved. Hunger hormones (ghrelin, leptin) remained in a manageable range. The calorie deficit did what it was supposed to do. 
#### 5.5 Hours of Sleep 

Subjects lost 55% more lean mass and 60% less fat. The calorie deficit was identical, but the body preferentially catabolized muscle and preserved fat. Ghrelin levels increased by 18%, driving significantly greater hunger. The same diet produced a fundamentally worse outcome solely because of sleep restriction. 

The mechanisms are straightforward. Sleep deprivation elevates cortisol (catabolic to muscle, promotes visceral fat storage), reduces growth hormone (impairs recovery and muscle protein synthesis), increases ghrelin (drives hunger and cravings for high-calorie foods), suppresses leptin (reduces satiety signaling), and impairs insulin sensitivity (shifts nutrient partitioning toward fat storage). 

This is why we see patients who are "doing everything right" — training hard, eating well, in a calorie deficit — but not getting the body composition results they expect. Before adjusting macros or adding another training session, the question is: how is your sleep? If the answer is 5 to 6 hours of fragmented sleep, that is the bottleneck. Fix the sleep, and the same inputs produce dramatically different outputs. 

**The bottom line: **Sleep deprivation turns a fat-loss diet into a muscle-loss diet. It is the single variable most likely to sabotage body composition goals, and it is the most commonly overlooked. If you are dieting and not sleeping, you are paying the cost of caloric restriction without getting the benefit. 
### PRACTICAL SLEEP OPTIMIZATION 

Sleep optimization is not complicated. It is a set of environmental controls and behavioral changes, most of which cost nothing and take effect within days. The challenge is consistency, not complexity. Here are the highest-leverage interventions, ranked by impact. 

1. Consistent Wake Time 

This is the single most important behavioral change for sleep quality. Your circadian rhythm is anchored primarily by your wake time, not your bedtime. Pick a wake time and hold it within a 30-minute window every day — including weekends. This sets your cortisol awakening response, aligns your melatonin onset, and makes your sleep drive predictable. Varying your wake time by 2 or more hours on weekends creates "social jet lag" that disrupts your circadian system as effectively as flying across time zones. 

2. Temperature: 65-68 degrees F 

Your core body temperature must drop by approximately 2 to 3 degrees Fahrenheit to initiate and maintain sleep. A room that is too warm is one of the most common and most easily fixed sleep disruptors. The optimal bedroom temperature for most adults is 65 to 68 degrees F (18 to 20 degrees C). This may feel cold when you get into bed, which is the point. Use a fan, lower the thermostat, or invest in a cooling mattress pad. Your body needs to lose heat to stay in deep sleep. A warm room fights this process all night. 

3. Light Exposure Timing 

Light is the primary zeitgeber (time-giver) for your circadian clock. Get bright light exposure — ideally sunlight — within 30 to 60 minutes of waking. This suppresses melatonin, triggers the cortisol awakening response, and starts the 12 to 14 hour countdown to melatonin onset that evening. Conversely, minimize bright light and blue light exposure for 2 to 3 hours before bed. Overhead lights, screens, and LEDs signal "daytime" to the suprachiasmatic nucleus and delay melatonin release. Dim the lights after sunset. Use blue-light-blocking glasses or warm-toned lighting if screens are unavoidable. The light environment you create in the evening directly determines how quickly you fall asleep and how much melatonin you produce. 

4. Caffeine Cutoff: 8+ Hours Before Bed 

Caffeine has a half-life of 5 to 7 hours, meaning that half the caffeine from an afternoon coffee is still in your system at bedtime. A quarter-life of 10 to 12 hours means a meaningful amount remains even the next morning. Caffeine blocks adenosine receptors — the molecule that builds sleep pressure throughout the day. Even if you can "fall asleep after coffee," caffeine measurably reduces deep sleep duration and sleep quality without necessarily affecting your ability to fall asleep. This is the insidious part: you feel like you slept, but your deep sleep was degraded. A minimum 8-hour cutoff before bed is the standard recommendation. For slow metabolizers (determined by CYP1A2 genotype), 10 to 12 hours may be necessary. 

5. Alcohol and Sleep 

Alcohol is a sedative, and sedation is not sleep. Alcohol may help you fall asleep faster, but it profoundly degrades sleep quality. It suppresses REM sleep, fragments sleep architecture in the second half of the night, increases sympathetic nervous system activation (elevated heart rate during sleep), and worsens sleep apnea. Even moderate consumption — two drinks — reduces sleep quality by approximately 24% (Ebrahim et al., 2013). The closer to bedtime, the greater the impact. If hormone optimization is the goal, alcohol within 3 hours of bed is one of the most counterproductive habits to maintain. 

6. Darkness and Noise Control 

Your bedroom should be dark enough that you cannot see your hand in front of your face. Any ambient light — streetlights, LEDs on electronics, hallway light under the door — signals your retina and suppresses melatonin production, even through closed eyelids. Blackout curtains or a quality sleep mask solve this. For noise, consistent low-frequency sound (white noise, fan) is superior to silence in most urban and suburban environments because it masks intermittent disruptions (traffic, pets, partners) that fragment sleep without fully waking you. 

**Priority order: **If you change nothing else, fix your wake time consistency and your room temperature. These two interventions produce the largest improvement in sleep quality for the least effort. Add light management and caffeine cutoff next. Then address alcohol and environmental factors. Stack these changes over 2 to 4 weeks and most patients report a noticeable improvement in energy, recovery, and morning alertness without any supplementation or medication. 
### WHEN TO INVESTIGATE FURTHER 

Good sleep hygiene solves the majority of sleep quality issues. But some patients do everything right — consistent schedule, cool room, no caffeine or alcohol, dark and quiet environment — and still wake up unrested. When behavioral optimization fails, there is usually a physiological cause that requires clinical investigation. 
#### Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) 

The most common and most underdiagnosed sleep disorder. OSA causes repeated upper airway collapse during sleep, resulting in oxygen desaturations, cortical arousals, and fragmented sleep architecture. It directly suppresses testosterone, impairs growth hormone release, elevates cortisol, and drives insulin resistance. An estimated 80% of moderate to severe OSA cases are undiagnosed. Risk factors include: BMI over 30, neck circumference over 17 inches (men) or 16 inches (women), snoring, witnessed apneas, and waking unrefreshed. A home sleep test or in-lab polysomnography can diagnose it. Treatment with CPAP or oral appliance therapy often produces dramatic improvements in energy, hormone levels, and body composition. 
#### Cortisol Dysregulation 

If you are wired at night but exhausted in the morning, your cortisol curve may be inverted or flattened. Normal cortisol is high in the morning and low at night. HPA axis dysfunction — driven by chronic stress, overtraining, or sleep debt itself — can flip this pattern. Evening cortisol testing (salivary or serum) can identify this. Elevated evening cortisol prevents sleep onset, reduces deep sleep, and creates a self-reinforcing cycle: poor sleep raises cortisol, which further impairs sleep. Breaking this cycle often requires addressing the stress inputs and supporting the HPA axis before sleep quality can normalize. 
#### Thyroid Dysfunction 

Both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism disrupt sleep. Hypothyroidism can cause excessive daytime sleepiness despite adequate sleep time and is associated with increased risk of sleep apnea. Hyperthyroidism causes insomnia, difficulty staying asleep, and elevated resting heart rate during sleep. A full thyroid panel — not just TSH — should be part of any workup for persistent sleep issues. 
#### Sex Hormone Imbalances 

Low testosterone is associated with increased sleep fragmentation and higher incidence of sleep apnea. Low progesterone in women impairs GABA-mediated sedation and is a common cause of perimenopausal insomnia. Estrogen fluctuations cause night sweats and sleep disruption. Hormone imbalances both result from and contribute to poor sleep — which is why addressing sleep and hormones together, rather than in isolation, produces the best outcomes. 

**The decision framework: **If you have implemented consistent sleep hygiene practices for 2 to 4 weeks and still wake unrested, experience daytime sleepiness, or show hormonal deficits on lab work despite adequate sleep time, it is time for clinical investigation. Sleep apnea screening, cortisol testing, and a full hormone panel can identify the underlying cause and direct treatment to the actual problem. 
### HOW MOONSHOT APPROACHES SLEEP AS PART OF HORMONE OPTIMIZATION 

At Moonshot, sleep is not a footnote in the treatment plan. It is an integral part of every hormone optimization protocol. We assess it clinically, test for disorders that impair it, and address it before or alongside any hormonal intervention. The reason is simple: if the foundation is broken, nothing built on top of it will perform as expected. 

1. Clinical Sleep Assessment 

Every new patient evaluation includes a structured sleep assessment: sleep duration, sleep latency (how long it takes to fall asleep), number of awakenings, wake time consistency, snoring history, daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale), and subjective sleep quality. This is not a checkbox exercise. Sleep data directly informs how we interpret hormone labs and what interventions we recommend. 

2. Targeted Lab Work 

When sleep-related endocrine dysfunction is suspected, we test the relevant markers: morning and evening cortisol (to assess the diurnal curve), testosterone (total and free), IGF-1 (a proxy for growth hormone status), fasting insulin and glucose (to evaluate metabolic impact), and thyroid panel. These results, interpreted in the context of a patient's sleep quality, reveal whether poor sleep is the primary driver of hormonal deficits or whether another pathology is compounding the problem. 

3. Sleep Disorder Screening and Referral 

For patients with clinical indicators of obstructive sleep apnea — snoring, witnessed apneas, high BMI, large neck circumference, refractory low testosterone, or unrefreshing sleep despite adequate duration — we coordinate sleep studies and treatment. Treating sleep apnea is often the highest-impact single intervention for testosterone, energy, and metabolic health in this population. We do not prescribe TRT for low testosterone caused by untreated sleep apnea without addressing the apnea first. 

4. Behavioral and Environmental Optimization 

We provide structured, actionable sleep optimization protocols — not vague advice to "sleep more." Specific targets for room temperature, light exposure timing, caffeine cutoff, alcohol guidelines, and wake time consistency. These are the same evidence-based recommendations outlined in this article, tailored to each patient's schedule and lifestyle constraints. 

5. Integration with Hormone Protocols 

For patients on TRT, peptide therapy (including growth hormone secretagogues), or other hormonal interventions, sleep optimization is not separate from the protocol — it is part of it. Growth hormone secretagogues like ipamorelin work by amplifying the natural GH pulse during deep sleep. If deep sleep is compromised, the intervention is less effective. TRT improves sleep quality in hypogonadal men, but the effect is maximized when sleep hygiene is concurrently optimized. We treat the system, not isolated variables. 

**Our position is simple: **Sleep is not a lifestyle recommendation. It is a clinical variable that directly determines hormone levels, metabolic health, body composition, and the effectiveness of every other intervention we offer. We treat it with the same rigor and specificity that we apply to lab work, medication dosing, and treatment monitoring. If your current provider is optimizing your hormones without asking about your sleep, they are missing the foundation. 
### COMMON QUESTIONS 
#### How much sleep do I actually need for optimal hormone production? 

For most adults, 7 to 9 hours of actual sleep time — not just time in bed — is the range where hormone production is optimized. Research consistently shows that sleeping fewer than 6 hours per night significantly reduces testosterone production, blunts growth hormone secretion, and dysregulates cortisol rhythms. The exact number varies by individual, but the data is clear: consistently sleeping under 7 hours compromises your endocrine system in measurable, clinically significant ways. If you're investing in hormone optimization but sleeping 5 to 6 hours a night, you're undermining the intervention at the foundation level. 
#### Can I catch up on sleep over the weekend to fix my hormones? 

No. Sleep debt doesn't work like a bank account where you can deposit extra on weekends to offset weekday deficits. While recovery sleep can partially restore some acute cognitive deficits, the hormonal damage from chronic sleep restriction is not fully reversible with weekend catch-up. A 2019 study in Current Biology (Depner et al.) found that weekend recovery sleep did not prevent metabolic dysregulation caused by insufficient sleep during the week. Testosterone production follows a circadian rhythm that requires consistent nightly sleep to maintain. Irregular sleep-wake patterns themselves — independent of total sleep duration — are associated with worse metabolic outcomes. Consistency matters more than occasional long nights. 
#### Does alcohol really affect sleep that much if I fall asleep faster? 

Yes. Alcohol is a sedative, and sedation is not sleep. Alcohol dramatically suppresses REM sleep — the stage critical for emotional regulation, memory consolidation, and cognitive function. It also fragments sleep architecture in the second half of the night as your body metabolizes the alcohol, causing frequent awakenings (many of which you won't remember). Even moderate alcohol consumption — two drinks — within 3 hours of bedtime reduces sleep quality by 24% (Ebrahim et al., 2013). The perception of falling asleep faster is real, but the quality of sleep you're getting is significantly degraded. If hormone optimization is the goal, alcohol close to bedtime is one of the highest-impact things to eliminate. 
#### Should I get tested for sleep apnea? 

If you snore, wake up unrefreshed despite adequate time in bed, experience daytime sleepiness, have a neck circumference over 17 inches (men) or 16 inches (women), or have a BMI over 30, you should be screened. Obstructive sleep apnea affects an estimated 20 to 30 percent of men and 10 to 15 percent of women, and the majority are undiagnosed. OSA causes repeated oxygen desaturations throughout the night, fragmenting sleep architecture and directly suppressing testosterone production, growth hormone release, and insulin sensitivity. Untreated sleep apnea makes hormone optimization significantly less effective — you can't out-supplement or out-prescribe a blocked airway. At Moonshot, we screen for sleep apnea as part of our hormone evaluation because it is one of the most common and most overlooked barriers to endocrine health. 
#### How does Moonshot incorporate sleep into hormone optimization? 

Sleep is part of our initial clinical assessment for every patient. We evaluate sleep duration, sleep quality, sleep timing, and screen for sleep disorders including obstructive sleep apnea. We review cortisol patterns — including evening cortisol — to identify HPA axis dysregulation that may be impairing sleep. For patients with signs of sleep apnea, we coordinate sleep studies and treatment. We also address the behavioral and environmental factors that degrade sleep quality: light exposure, temperature, caffeine timing, alcohol use, and sleep schedule consistency. Optimizing hormones without fixing sleep is like tuning an engine while the fuel line is kinked. We fix the foundation first, then build on it.

### Vitamin D & Key Micronutrients: The Hidden Bottlenecks in Optimization
URL: https://moonshotmp.com/learn/vitamin-d-micronutrients/

← Back to Learn 

Diagnostics & Optimization 
## VITAMIN D & KEY MICRONUTRIENTS 

The most expensive supplement stack in the world is worthless if you're correcting the wrong deficiencies. Micronutrient testing reveals the hidden bottlenecks silently undermining your hormones, energy, immune function, and metabolism. 
### WHY DEFICIENCIES ARE EPIDEMIC IN WELL-FED POPULATIONS 

Americans eat more calories than any population in human history and are simultaneously among the most micronutrient-depleted. This is not a paradox. It is the predictable result of how modern food is grown, processed, and consumed. 

Industrial agriculture prioritizes yield per acre, not nutrient density per calorie. A landmark study published in the *Journal of the American College of Nutrition *(Davis et al., 2004) compared USDA nutrient data from 1950 to 1999 and found statistically significant declines in protein, calcium, phosphorus, iron, riboflavin, and vitamin C across 43 garden crops. The soil is depleted. The crops reflect it. And that's before processing strips what little remains. 

On top of that, several modern realities compound the problem: 
#### Soil Depletion 

Mineral content in agricultural soil has declined 20-40% over the past 50 years due to monocropping, synthetic fertilizers (which replenish NPK but not trace minerals), and erosion. Selenium, zinc, magnesium, and iron in crops track directly with soil content. The food looks the same. It is not the same. 
#### Food Processing 

Refining wheat into white flour removes approximately 80% of the magnesium, 70% of the zinc, and 85% of the vitamin B6. Ultra-processed foods now account for over 60% of calories consumed in America (Martínez Steele et al., 2016, *BMJ Open *). These foods are calorie-dense and micronutrient-poor by design. 
#### Indoor Living & Sunscreen 

Humans evolved making vitamin D from UVB sunlight exposure. Modern life means most people spend 90%+ of their time indoors. When they do go outside, sunscreen blocks UVB-mediated vitamin D synthesis. Geographic latitude matters too — anyone living above the 37th parallel (roughly a line from San Francisco to Richmond, Virginia) cannot produce meaningful vitamin D from sunlight for 4-6 months of the year. 
#### Medications That Deplete 

Metformin depletes B12. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) deplete magnesium, B12, and iron absorption. Oral contraceptives deplete B6, B12, folate, magnesium, and zinc. Statins deplete CoQ10. Diuretics deplete magnesium and potassium. These are among the most commonly prescribed drugs in America, and nutrient depletion is rarely monitored. 
#### Increased Demand 

Chronic stress increases magnesium excretion. Exercise increases zinc, iron, and magnesium requirements. Pregnancy dramatically increases demand for iron, folate, and vitamin D. The RDA was designed for preventing frank deficiency diseases in sedentary populations — not for supporting performance, recovery, or optimal hormonal function. 
#### Gut Dysfunction 

You don't absorb what you eat — you absorb what you digest and transport across an intact intestinal lining. Gut inflammation, dysbiosis, low stomach acid, celiac disease, and SIBO all impair micronutrient absorption regardless of dietary intake. This is why some patients remain deficient despite supplementing. 

**The takeaway: **Eating a "healthy diet" is necessary but frequently insufficient. The food supply has changed. Lifestyle demands have increased. And the RDA was designed to prevent scurvy and rickets, not to optimize hormone production, immune function, or cognitive performance. Testing is the only way to know what your body actually has versus what it needs. 
### VITAMIN D: THE MOST IMPORTANT NUTRIENT MOST PEOPLE ARE MISSING 

Vitamin D is misnamed. It is not a vitamin — it is a prohormone. Your body synthesizes it from cholesterol when UVB radiation hits the skin, converts it to 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH D) in the liver, and then to the active form 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol) in the kidneys and other tissues. Calcitriol functions as a steroid hormone, binding to vitamin D receptors (VDR) present in virtually every cell in the body. This is why its effects are so far-reaching. 

The numbers are staggering. An estimated 42% of American adults are vitamin D deficient (<20 ng/mL), and over 70% are below the optimal threshold of 50 ng/mL (Forrest & Stuhldreher, 2011, *Nutrition Research *). Darker-skinned individuals, those living at northern latitudes, the obese, and the elderly are at even higher risk. This is arguably the single most prevalent nutritional deficiency in the developed world. 

Immune Function 

Vitamin D activates antimicrobial peptides (cathelicidin, defensins) in innate immunity and modulates adaptive immune responses. Deficiency is associated with increased susceptibility to respiratory infections, autoimmune diseases, and impaired vaccine response. A meta-analysis by Martineau et al. (2017) in the *BMJ *involving over 11,000 participants found that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of acute respiratory tract infections, with the greatest benefit in those who were most deficient. 

Testosterone & Hormone Production 

Vitamin D receptors are present in Leydig cells (the cells that produce testosterone ). A randomized controlled trial by Pilz et al. (2011) in *Hormone and Metabolic Research *found that men supplementing with vitamin D for one year had significantly higher testosterone levels compared to placebo. Vitamin D also influences SHBG levels and estrogen metabolism. In the context of hormone optimization, correcting vitamin D deficiency is a prerequisite, not an afterthought. 

Bone Density & Calcium Metabolism 

This is the function most people know about, and it is real. Vitamin D regulates calcium absorption from the gut and calcium/phosphorus homeostasis in bone. Without adequate vitamin D, you absorb only 10-15% of dietary calcium (versus 30-40% when vitamin D is sufficient). Long-term deficiency leads to osteomalacia in adults and rickets in children. But framing vitamin D as a "bone vitamin" dramatically understates its importance. 

Mood, Cognition & Insulin Sensitivity 

Vitamin D receptors are densely concentrated in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Deficiency is associated with increased risk of depression (Anglin et al., 2013, *British Journal of Psychiatry *), cognitive decline, and Alzheimer's disease. Vitamin D also improves insulin sensitivity by upregulating insulin receptor expression and modulating inflammatory cytokines. Low vitamin D is independently associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes. 

Cancer Risk Reduction 

Observational data consistently shows that higher vitamin D levels are associated with reduced risk of colorectal, breast, and prostate cancers. A pooled analysis by Garland et al. (2006) in the *American Journal of Public Health *estimated that maintaining 25-OH D levels above 52 ng/mL was associated with a 50% reduction in colorectal cancer incidence. The VITAL trial (Manson et al., 2019, *NEJM *) showed a reduction in cancer mortality with vitamin D supplementation, though not overall cancer incidence. The mechanism: vitamin D regulates cell differentiation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. 25-OH Vitamin D Level Classification < 20 ng/mL Deficient 20 – 29 ng/mL Insufficient 30 – 49 ng/mL Adequate (conventional), Suboptimal (functional) 50 – 80 ng/mL Optimal > 100 ng/mL Potentially toxic (monitor calcium) 

**Dosing and cofactors: **Most adults need 4,000-5,000 IU of vitamin D3 per day to reach and maintain optimal levels. Obese individuals may need 6,000-10,000 IU due to sequestration in adipose tissue. Vitamin D should always be taken with vitamin K2 (MK-7 form, 100-200 mcg/day) to direct calcium into bones and out of arteries, and with magnesium, which is required for vitamin D activation and metabolism. Test: 25-OH vitamin D. Recheck 8-12 weeks after starting supplementation. 
### MAGNESIUM & IRON: THE TWO MOST UNDER-TESTED DEFICIENCIES 

If vitamin D is the most common deficiency, magnesium and iron are the most consequential ones that standard medicine fails to test properly. Both are involved in hundreds of biochemical processes, both are chronically under-consumed, and both are assessed with the wrong lab tests by most practitioners. 
#### MAGNESIUM 

Magnesium is a cofactor in over 300 enzymatic reactions, including ATP production, DNA synthesis, protein synthesis, neurotransmitter release, and muscle contraction. It is required for the activation of vitamin D and for proper thyroid hormone conversion (T4 to T3) . Despite its central role in human physiology, the USDA estimates that over 50% of Americans consume less than the estimated average requirement for magnesium. 

The standard test — serum magnesium — is almost useless for detecting deficiency. Less than 1% of total body magnesium resides in serum. The body tightly regulates serum magnesium by pulling from bone and tissue stores, meaning serum levels stay "normal" until stores are severely depleted. **RBC magnesium **is the better test — it reflects intracellular magnesium status and catches depletion much earlier. Optimal RBC magnesium: 5.0-6.5 mg/dL. 

Glycinate 

Best for sleep , anxiety, and general repletion. Glycine has independent calming effects on the nervous system. Well-absorbed, minimal GI side effects. 

Threonate (Magtein) 

The only form shown to effectively cross the blood-brain barrier. Best for cognitive function, memory, and neuroprotection. Backed by preclinical data from MIT (Bhatt et al., 2020). 

Taurate 

Preferred for cardiovascular support. Taurine independently supports blood pressure regulation, cardiac rhythm stability, and endothelial function. 

**Symptoms of magnesium depletion: **insomnia, muscle cramps, anxiety, headaches, elevated blood pressure, heart palpitations, constipation, poor exercise recovery, and impaired insulin sensitivity. Many of these get treated with separate medications when the root cause is a $15/month mineral. 
#### IRON & FERRITIN 

Iron is essential for oxygen transport (hemoglobin), energy production (mitochondrial cytochromes), thyroid hormone conversion, neurotransmitter synthesis, and DNA replication. Ferritin is the storage form of iron — your body's iron reserve. And ferritin is where most deficiency hides, undetected. 

Here is the problem: most doctors check a CBC (hemoglobin, hematocrit) and call it done. Hemoglobin drops only after iron stores are completely exhausted — it is the last domino to fall. A patient can have a hemoglobin of 12.5 g/dL (technically "normal") and a ferritin of 12 ng/mL (functionally depleted). That patient will have fatigue, hair loss, brain fog, cold intolerance, poor exercise tolerance, and impaired thyroid function — and be told everything is fine. Ferritin Level Status < 30 ng/mL Depleted (iron deficiency regardless of hemoglobin) 30 – 50 ng/mL Suboptimal (symptomatic in many patients) 50 – 150 ng/mL (women) Optimal 75 – 150 ng/mL (men) Optimal > 200 ng/mL Elevated (investigate: inflammation, hemochromatosis) 

**Who is most at risk: **Menstruating women (monthly blood loss), athletes (exercise-induced hemolysis and GI iron loss), vegetarians/vegans (non-heme iron is poorly absorbed), anyone on PPIs (acid is required for iron absorption), and patients with gut inflammation or celiac disease. Iron is also a critical cofactor for the 5'-deiodinase enzyme that converts thyroid T4 to active T3 — meaning iron deficiency can directly cause functional hypothyroidism. 
### B12, ZINC & SELENIUM: THE OVERLOOKED TRIAD 

These three micronutrients don't get the attention of vitamin D or iron, but they are quietly involved in some of the most critical biochemical processes in the body — from testosterone production to thyroid conversion to methylation and detoxification. Deficiency in any one of them can stall optimization even when everything else looks good on paper. 

Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin) 

B12 is essential for red blood cell formation, neurological function, DNA synthesis, and methylation — the process by which your body activates and deactivates genes, processes hormones, and detoxifies metabolic waste. Deficiency causes fatigue, peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling), cognitive impairment, depression, and macrocytic anemia. Populations at highest risk: vegetarians and vegans (B12 is found almost exclusively in animal products), adults over 50 (decreased intrinsic factor and stomach acid), metformin users (metformin impairs B12 absorption in the ileum — prevalence of deficiency in long-term metformin users is 10-30%), and anyone on PPIs. The standard serum B12 test is a poor screening tool — levels can be "normal" while functional B12 status is inadequate. **Methylmalonic acid (MMA) **is a more sensitive and specific marker. An elevated MMA with a "normal" serum B12 confirms functional deficiency. Optimal serum B12: above 500 pg/mL (not just above 200). 

Zinc 

Zinc is a cofactor in over 100 enzymatic reactions and is critical for testosterone production, immune function, wound healing, thyroid conversion (T4 to T3), taste and smell, and gene expression. Zinc is required for the function of the enzyme 5-alpha reductase and for Leydig cell testosterone synthesis — making it foundational for male hormone optimization. In women, zinc deficiency is associated with menstrual irregularity and impaired follicular development. Zinc also supports immune function: even mild deficiency impairs T-cell and natural killer cell activity. The challenge: zinc competes with copper for absorption, so supplementing zinc without monitoring copper can create a secondary deficiency. Optimal serum zinc: 90-120 mcg/dL. Dose: 30-50 mg/day of zinc picolinate or zinc bisglycinate (highly bioavailable forms). Always balance with 1-2 mg copper if supplementing above 30 mg/day long-term. 

Selenium 

Selenium is a trace mineral that most people have never thought about, yet it is essential for two of the most important enzyme systems in the body. First: the **5'-deiodinase enzymes **that convert thyroid T4 to active T3 are selenoproteins — meaning they literally cannot function without selenium. Second: **glutathione peroxidase **, your body's primary intracellular antioxidant enzyme, is selenium-dependent. Without adequate selenium, you cannot convert thyroid hormone efficiently and you cannot neutralize oxidative stress effectively. Selenium is also critical for thyroid autoimmunity — a meta-analysis by Wichman et al. (2016, *Thyroid *) found that selenium supplementation significantly reduced TPO antibody levels in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis . Optimal dose: 200 mcg/day of selenomethionine. Selenium has a narrow therapeutic window — doses above 400 mcg/day risk toxicity (selenosis). More is not better. 

**The interconnection matters: **These nutrients don't work in isolation. Zinc and selenium are both required for thyroid T4-to-T3 conversion. B12 and zinc are both required for proper methylation. Iron and B12 are both required for red blood cell production. Correcting one deficiency while ignoring the others is like fixing one flat tire on a car with four. This is why a comprehensive panel — not individual spot-checks — is the only way to identify and resolve the actual bottleneck. 
### OMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDS: THE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY FOUNDATION 

Omega-3 fatty acids — specifically EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) — are not just another supplement trend. They are structural components of every cell membrane in your body and precursors to resolvins and protectins, the molecules your body uses to resolve inflammation. The typical American diet delivers an omega-6 to omega-3 ratio of approximately 15:1 to 20:1. The evolutionary ratio: closer to 2:1. This imbalance drives chronic, low-grade systemic inflammation — the underlying substrate of cardiovascular disease, neurodegeneration, metabolic dysfunction, and autoimmunity. 

DHA makes up approximately 40% of the polyunsaturated fatty acids in the brain and 60% of the fatty acids in the retina. It is neuroprotective, supporting synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis, and cognitive function across the lifespan. EPA is the more potent anti-inflammatory of the two, inhibiting pro-inflammatory eicosanoid synthesis and reducing CRP, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. 

Cardiovascular benefits are well-established. The REDUCE-IT trial (Bhatt et al., 2019, *NEJM *) demonstrated that high-dose EPA (icosapent ethyl, 4g/day) reduced cardiovascular events by 25% in patients with elevated triglycerides. Omega-3s lower triglycerides, reduce platelet aggregation, improve endothelial function, and stabilize atherosclerotic plaque. 
#### Cardiovascular 

Lowers triglycerides 15-30%. Reduces resting heart rate. Improves arterial elasticity. Reduces risk of arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. 
#### Neurological 

DHA supports synaptic function and myelination. Associated with reduced risk of depression, cognitive decline, and Alzheimer's disease. Critical during pregnancy for fetal brain development. 
#### Anti-inflammatory 

EPA and DHA are precursors to specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) that actively resolve inflammation. Reduces CRP, IL-6, and other inflammatory markers implicated in chronic disease. 

**How to test and dose: **The **Omega-3 Index **measures EPA + DHA as a percentage of total red blood cell fatty acids. Target: 8-12% (the range associated with the lowest cardiovascular risk). Most Americans are in the 4-5% range. To reach optimal levels, most adults need 2-4 grams of combined EPA + DHA per day from high-quality fish oil or algal oil. Quality matters — look for third-party tested products (IFOS certification) to verify purity and potency. 
### HOW MOONSHOT TESTS AND CORRECTS MICRONUTRIENT DEFICIENCIES 

Guessing at supplements is expensive and ineffective. The supplement industry is built on guessing. Buy this multivitamin. Take this stack. Hope it works. That approach ignores the fundamental question: what are you actually deficient in, and how much do you need to reach optimal levels? At Moonshot, we test first, dose based on data, and verify with follow-up labs. 

1. Comprehensive Panel 

Our blood work covers the micronutrients that matter most: 25-OH vitamin D, RBC magnesium, ferritin, serum iron, TIBC, transferrin saturation, vitamin B12, serum zinc, and inflammatory markers (hs-CRP, homocysteine) that indicate micronutrient-related dysfunction. We also assess thyroid markers (TSH, Free T3, Free T4, Reverse T3) alongside micronutrients because the two are inseparable — you cannot optimize thyroid function without adequate selenium, iron, zinc, and vitamin D. The Omega-3 Index is available for patients focused on cardiovascular and neurological optimization. 

2. Clinical Interpretation, Not Just Reference Ranges 

A vitamin D of 32 ng/mL is "normal." A ferritin of 15 ng/mL is "normal." A B12 of 220 pg/mL is "normal." And a patient with all three of those values will feel terrible — tired, foggy, cold, losing hair, sleeping poorly, and struggling in the gym. We interpret results in the context of optimal ranges, your symptoms, your goals, and the interactions between markers. A low ferritin in the context of a suboptimal Free T3 tells a different clinical story than low ferritin alone. 

3. Targeted Supplementation Protocols 

Based on your results, we build a specific protocol — the right nutrients, the right forms, the right doses. Not a generic multivitamin. We specify the form of magnesium based on your primary concern, select the right iron formulation based on your tolerance and absorption capacity, and dose vitamin D based on your starting level and body composition. We also account for cofactor dependencies: vitamin D with K2 and magnesium, zinc balanced with copper, iron separated from calcium and thyroid medication. 

4. Injectable Options for Severe Deficiency 

For patients with severe deficiencies that aren't responding to oral supplementation — or who have absorption issues (gut inflammation, celiac disease, gastric bypass) — we offer injectable options. **B12 injections **(hydroxocobalamin or methylcobalamin) bypass the GI tract entirely, delivering 100% bioavailability. This is especially important for patients on metformin, those with pernicious anemia or intrinsic factor deficiency, and vegans with long-standing B12 depletion. We also offer **NAD+ infusions **for cellular energy optimization and DNA repair support. 

5. Follow-Up Testing 

Supplementation without follow-up is guessing with extra steps. We recheck levels 8-12 weeks after initiating protocols to verify you've reached optimal levels, adjust doses as needed, and ensure there are no issues with over-repletion (especially iron, where excess carries its own risks). The goal is to move from deficient or suboptimal to the optimal range — and keep you there. 
### COMMON QUESTIONS 
#### Why are micronutrient deficiencies so common if I eat a healthy diet? 

Modern food production has fundamentally changed what's in your food. Industrial farming has depleted soil mineral content by 20-40% over the past 50 years. Crops are bred for yield and appearance, not nutrient density. Processing strips vitamins and minerals further. On top of that, chronic stress, medications (PPIs, metformin, oral contraceptives), gut dysfunction, and higher metabolic demands from exercise all increase your requirements beyond what even a clean diet typically provides. A 2020 analysis in the journal *Nutrients *found that over 90% of Americans fail to meet the estimated average requirement for vitamin D, and over 50% fall short on magnesium. Eating well is necessary but often not sufficient — which is why testing, not guessing, is the only way to know where you actually stand. 
#### How much vitamin D should I take daily? 

The RDA of 600-800 IU per day is based on bone health and is far too low to reach optimal serum levels for most adults. Research from the Endocrine Society suggests that most adults need 4,000-5,000 IU per day to reach and maintain a 25-OH vitamin D level of 50-80 ng/mL — the range associated with the best outcomes for immune function, hormone production, mood, and cancer risk reduction. However, the right dose depends on your starting level, body composition (vitamin D is fat-soluble and sequestered in adipose tissue — heavier individuals need more), skin pigmentation, and sun exposure. This is why we test first and dose accordingly, rather than using a one-size-fits-all number. Vitamin D should always be taken with K2 and magnesium as cofactors. 
#### What's the best form of magnesium to take? 

It depends on what you're trying to address. Magnesium glycinate is the best general-purpose form — well-absorbed, gentle on the gut, and particularly effective for sleep quality and anxiety reduction due to glycine's calming effect. Magnesium threonate (Magtein) is the only form shown to cross the blood-brain barrier effectively, making it the best choice for cognitive function, memory, and neuroprotection. Magnesium taurate is preferred for cardiovascular support — taurine has independent benefits for blood pressure and heart rhythm. Avoid magnesium oxide — it has the highest elemental magnesium content but the worst absorption (around 4%), so most of it passes through you as a laxative. Many people benefit from stacking two forms — for example, glycinate at night for sleep and threonate in the morning for cognition. 
#### My doctor says my iron is normal. Could I still be deficient? 

Yes — this is one of the most common missed diagnoses in medicine. Most doctors check hemoglobin and hematocrit as part of a CBC. If those are in range, they tell you your iron is fine. But hemoglobin is the last thing to drop in iron deficiency — it only falls after your iron stores are completely depleted. Ferritin is the storage form of iron and drops long before hemoglobin does. A ferritin of 15 ng/mL is technically "in range" at most labs (reference range starts at 10-12), but it's functionally depleted. Patients with ferritin below 50 commonly experience fatigue, hair loss, brain fog, exercise intolerance, cold intolerance, and impaired thyroid conversion. Optimal ferritin is 50-150 ng/mL for women and 75-150 ng/mL for men. At Moonshot, we always test ferritin alongside a full iron panel — serum iron, TIBC, and transferrin saturation — because the complete picture matters. 
#### Does Moonshot test for all of these micronutrients? 

Yes. Our comprehensive blood panel includes 25-OH vitamin D, ferritin, serum iron, TIBC, transferrin saturation, vitamin B12, RBC magnesium, zinc, and inflammatory markers that indicate micronutrient-related dysfunction. We also offer the Omega-3 Index test for patients optimizing cardiovascular and neurological health. For patients with identified deficiencies that aren't responding adequately to oral supplementation — or for those who need faster repletion — we offer injectable options including B12 injections and NAD+ infusions. The goal is always to identify the specific bottleneck, correct it with the right form and dose, and verify with follow-up testing that you've actually reached optimal levels. Guessing at supplements without testing is expensive and ineffective.

### TRT vs Enclomiphene: Which is Right for You?
URL: https://moonshotmp.com/medical/trt-vs-enclomiphene/

← Back to Men's Hormones 
## TRT VS ENCLOMIPHENE 

Two approaches to optimizing testosterone. One replaces it. One stimulates natural production. Here's how to decide. 
### THE SHORT VERSION 
#### Choose TRT if: 

- Fertility is not a concern 
- You want maximum testosterone levels 
- You're committed to long-term therapy 
- Natural production is already very low 
#### Choose Enclomiphene if: 

- You want to preserve fertility 
- You prefer stimulating natural production 
- Your testosterone is low but not severely 
- You want to avoid testicular atrophy 
### HEAD-TO-HEAD COMPARISON Factor TRT Enclomiphene How it works Directly adds testosterone Stimulates natural production Fertility impact Suppresses (reversible) Preserves fertility Testosterone increase Higher, more controllable Moderate (200-400+ pts) Testicular size May decrease Maintained or increased Administration Injections (weekly) Oral (daily pill) Stopping therapy Recovery period needed Easier to discontinue Best for Max optimization, long-term Fertility-preserving, natural 
### HOW EACH WORKS 
#### TRT (Testosterone Replacement) 

TRT adds testosterone directly into your system, typically via weekly injections. This bypasses your body's natural production pathway. 

When you add external testosterone, your brain detects the higher levels and stops sending signals (LH/FSH) to your testes. This means your testes stop producing testosterone and sperm. 

**Result: **Higher, more consistent testosterone levels, but dependent on continued therapy. 
#### Enclomiphene 

Enclomiphene blocks estrogen receptors in your brain. Your brain then thinks estrogen is low and responds by increasing LH and FSH signals. 

These signals tell your testes to produce more testosterone naturally. Your body's feedback loop stays intact, and sperm production continues. 

**Result: **Increased natural testosterone production while maintaining fertility. 
### WHY ENCLOMIPHENE, NOT CLOMID? 

You may have heard of Clomid (clomiphene citrate) for boosting testosterone. It works through the same mechanism—blocking estrogen receptors to increase LH/FSH. So why do we use Enclomiphene instead? 

**Clomid is a mix of two isomers: **enclomiphene and zuclomiphene. Think of them as mirror-image molecules. Enclomiphene is the "good" isomer that raises testosterone. Zuclomiphene is the "bad" isomer that acts like a weak estrogen and causes most of Clomid's side effects. 
#### Clomid (Mixed Isomers) 

- Contains both enclomiphene AND zuclomiphene 
- Zuclomiphene has estrogenic effects 
- Common side effects: mood swings, visual disturbances, emotional blunting 
- Zuclomiphene accumulates over time (long half-life) 
- Originally developed for female fertility 
#### Enclomiphene (Pure Isomer) 

- Pure trans-isomer only—no zuclomiphene 
- No estrogenic side effects 
- Better tolerated, fewer mood issues 
- Cleaner mechanism of action 
- Designed specifically for male hypogonadism 

**Bottom line: **Enclomiphene gives you the testosterone-boosting benefits without the estrogenic baggage. If you've tried Clomid and felt "off," experienced mood changes, or had visual symptoms—Enclomiphene is the cleaner alternative. 
### THE FERTILITY QUESTION 

This is often the deciding factor. If you might want children in the future—or want to keep that option open—Enclomiphene is typically the better choice. 

TRT doesn't permanently sterilize most men, but it does suppress sperm production while you're on it. Recovery after stopping can take 6-12+ months, and some men need additional medications (like HCG) to restart production. 

If fertility is not a concern (you're done having kids, or it's not in your plans), TRT offers more control over your testosterone levels. 
### OUR APPROACH AT MOONSHOT 

We don't push one option over the other. The right choice depends on your labs, symptoms, goals, and life circumstances. 

Every patient starts with comprehensive bloodwork. We look at total testosterone, free testosterone, LH, FSH, estradiol, and other markers to understand your full hormonal picture. 

Some men are good candidates for Enclomiphene. Others need TRT. Some start with Enclomiphene and transition to TRT later. We guide you through the decision based on data, not ideology.

Hormone optimization program + medication 

Enclomiphene Add-On 

$208/mo 

Can be standalone or with other protocols 
### COMMON QUESTIONS 
#### Can I use both TRT and Enclomiphene together? 

Not typically. Since TRT suppresses LH/FSH, Enclomiphene wouldn't have the desired effect. However, some protocols use HCG alongside TRT to maintain testicular function. We can discuss what makes sense for you. 
#### How long does Enclomiphene take to work? 

Most men see testosterone increases within 2-4 weeks. We recheck labs at 6-8 weeks to assess response and adjust if needed. 
#### What if Enclomiphene doesn't raise my testosterone enough? 

Some men are "non-responders" or don't get sufficient increases. In those cases, we may discuss transitioning to TRT or exploring other options. Your response to treatment guides next steps. 
### NOT SURE WHICH IS RIGHT FOR YOU? 

Start with labs. We'll review your results and discuss which approach makes sense for your goals.

### GLP-1 Weight Loss vs Other Methods: Semaglutide, Tirzepatide Compared
URL: https://moonshotmp.com/medical/glp1-vs-other-weight-loss/

← Back to Weight Loss 
## GLP-1 VS OTHER WEIGHT LOSS METHODS 

How do medications like semaglutide and tirzepatide compare to diet, exercise, surgery, and other approaches? Here's an evidence-based breakdown. 
### AVERAGE WEIGHT LOSS BY METHOD 

Diet + Exercise 

5-10% 

Semaglutide 

15-20% 

Tirzepatide 

20-25% 

Bariatric Surgery 

25-35% 

Based on clinical trial data. Individual results vary. 
### DETAILED COMPARISON 
#### GLP-1s vs Diet & Exercise Alone 
##### Diet & Exercise 

- Average 5-10% weight loss 
- High relapse rate (most regain) 
- No medication side effects 
- Builds sustainable habits 
- No ongoing cost (gym optional) 
- Requires significant willpower 
##### GLP-1 Medications 

- Average 15-25% weight loss 
- Weight regain if stopped 
- Possible GI side effects 
- Reduces appetite naturally 
- Ongoing medication cost 
- Works with your biology 

**Bottom line: **GLP-1s produce significantly more weight loss, but work best when combined with diet and exercise. The medication makes it easier to stick to healthy habits by reducing hunger and cravings. 
#### GLP-1s vs Bariatric Surgery 
##### Bariatric Surgery 

- 25-35% average weight loss 
- More durable long-term 
- One-time procedure 
- Surgical risks (1-2% complication) 
- Irreversible (most types) 
- Strict dietary requirements after 
##### GLP-1 Medications 

- 15-25% average weight loss 
- Requires ongoing use 
- Non-invasive 
- GI side effects possible 
- Fully reversible (stop anytime) 
- No surgical recovery 

**Bottom line: **Surgery produces more weight loss and is more durable, but GLP-1s offer significant results without the risks and permanence of surgery. Many patients try GLP-1s before considering surgery. 
#### GLP-1s vs Other Weight Loss Medications Medication Avg Weight Loss How It Works Semaglutide (Wegovy) 15-20% GLP-1 receptor agonist Tirzepatide (Zepbound) 20-25% GLP-1 + GIP dual agonist Phentermine 5-10% Appetite suppressant (stimulant) Contrave 5-8% Naltrexone + bupropion Orlistat (Alli) 3-5% Fat absorption blocker 
### THE REAL QUESTION: SUSTAINABILITY 

Every weight loss method has one thing in common: the challenge is keeping the weight off. 

GLP-1 medications produce impressive results, but studies show most people regain weight after stopping. This isn't a failure of the medication—it reflects the biology of weight regulation. 

Our approach at Moonshot focuses on two things: 
#### 1. Preserve Muscle 

Rapid weight loss often means muscle loss. We use DEXA scans to track body composition and ensure you're losing fat, not muscle. Muscle preservation is critical for metabolic health and maintaining results. 
#### 2. Build Habits 

The medication makes it easier to eat less. We help you use that window to build sustainable nutrition and exercise habits so you're not dependent on the medication forever. 
### GLP-1 WEIGHT LOSS AT MOONSHOT 

Full Program 

$405/mo 

- GLP-1 medication included 
- Medical oversight 
- Required labs & diagnostics 
- DEXA body composition tracking 
- Dosing adjustments 

Prescription Only 

$105/mo 

- Medical oversight 
- Rx sent to your pharmacy

### COMMON QUESTIONS 
#### Who is a good candidate for GLP-1 medications? 

Generally, patients with BMI 30+ (or 27+ with weight-related conditions) who haven't achieved goals with diet and exercise alone. We evaluate each patient individually based on health history, labs, and goals. 
#### What are the side effects of GLP-1 medications? 

Most common are GI-related: nausea, constipation, diarrhea—especially when starting or increasing dose. These typically improve over time. We start with low doses and titrate slowly to minimize side effects. 
#### Semaglutide vs Tirzepatide—which is better? 

Tirzepatide (dual GLP-1/GIP agonist) shows slightly higher weight loss in trials, but both are effective. The best choice depends on individual response, side effects, and availability. We can discuss options during your consultation. 
Start with a consultation. We'll review your health history and discuss whether GLP-1 therapy is right for you.

### Moonshot vs Typical Hormone & Weight Loss Clinics
URL: https://moonshotmp.com/medical/moonshot-vs-typical-clinic/

← Back to Medical Services 
## MOONSHOT VS TYPICAL CLINICS 

Not all hormone and weight loss clinics are the same. Here's an honest look at how we're different—and where we might not be the right fit. 
### THE CURRENT LANDSCAPE 

The hormone and weight loss space has exploded. Telehealth TRT clinics, GLP-1 prescription mills, and "anti-aging" centers are everywhere. 

Many operate on a simple model: minimal labs, quick video call, prescription shipped to your door. It's convenient. It's also often incomplete. 

We built Moonshot because we wanted something different—not just for patients, but because one of our founders needed it himself. Read that story here. 
### HEAD-TO-HEAD COMPARISON Factor Typical Clinic Moonshot Lab work Basic panel (10-15 markers) Comprehensive (60+ markers) Body composition Scale weight only DEXA scans included Care model Telehealth/video calls In-person (Park Ridge, IL) Reference ranges "Normal" (based on sick populations) Optimal (performance lens) Ongoing monitoring Minimal / as-needed Labs every 6 months, DEXA 2x/year Approach Symptom → prescription Data → diagnosis → plan Goal Treat symptoms Optimize function long-term 
### WHAT WE DO DIFFERENTLY 
#### Comprehensive Labs 

We test 60+ biomarkers—not just testosterone or thyroid. Hormones, metabolic markers, inflammation, cardiovascular risk, nutrients. The full picture. 

Why? Because low testosterone might be caused by thyroid dysfunction, or inflammation, or insulin resistance. You can't optimize what you don't understand. 
#### DEXA Body Composition 

The scale tells you almost nothing. DEXA tells you exactly how much fat, muscle, and bone you have—and where. 

This matters especially for weight loss. You want to lose fat, not muscle. DEXA lets us track that precisely and adjust your protocol accordingly. 
#### In-Person Care 

We're a real clinic in Park Ridge, IL. We draw your blood, run your DEXA, and see you face-to-face. 

This isn't about being anti-technology. It's about building real relationships and providing hands-on care that telehealth can't replicate. 
#### Performance Lens 

"Normal" lab ranges are based on general populations—including sick people. We interpret results through an optimization lens. 

Being "normal" isn't the goal. We want you functioning optimally—energy, body composition, cognition, longevity. 
### WHEN MOONSHOT MIGHT NOT BE RIGHT FOR YOU 

We're not the right fit for everyone. Here's when another option might make more sense: 
#### You just want a quick prescription 

If you already know exactly what you want and don't care about comprehensive testing or monitoring, a telehealth clinic will be faster and possibly cheaper upfront. We take a more thorough approach. 
#### You're not local to Chicago/northwest suburbs 

We're an in-person clinic. If you're not able to come to Park Ridge for labs, DEXA scans, and consultations, we're not the right geographic fit. 
#### You want the cheapest possible option 

When you factor in comprehensive labs and DEXA tracking, our pricing is competitive. But if rock-bottom cost is the priority over thorough care, there are cheaper options. 
### REAL COST COMPARISON 

Telehealth clinics often look cheaper until you add up what's actually included. 
#### Typical Telehealth Clinic 

- Monthly subscription $150-200 
- Basic labs (2x/year) $200-400 
- DEXA scan Not offered 
- Comprehensive labs Extra $300+ 
- True annual cost $2,500+ 
#### Moonshot 

- Monthly program $208 
- Comprehensive labs (2x/year) Included 
- DEXA scans (2x/year) Included 
- Vitamin injection (monthly) Included 
- True annual cost $2,496 

*Medication costs vary by protocol and are additional for both options.

## DAILY TADALAFIL 

Most people know tadalafil (Cialis) for erectile dysfunction. But daily low-dose tadalafil does much more—it's a systemic vasodilator with benefits for blood flow, prostate health, cardiovascular function, and metabolic health. 

Here's why we prescribe it as part of optimization protocols, not just for ED. 
### HOW TADALAFIL WORKS 

Tadalafil is a PDE5 inhibitor. PDE5 is an enzyme that breaks down cGMP, a molecule that relaxes smooth muscle and dilates blood vessels. By inhibiting PDE5, tadalafil keeps cGMP levels elevated, resulting in: 

- 1. **Vasodilation **— Blood vessels relax and widen, improving blood flow throughout the body 
- 2. **Smooth muscle relaxation **— Affects the penis (erections), prostate, bladder, and blood vessel walls 
- 3. **Improved endothelial function **— The endothelium (blood vessel lining) works better, producing more nitric oxide 

Unlike sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil has a long half-life (17.5 hours), making it ideal for daily dosing. At 5mg daily, you maintain steady blood levels rather than peaks and troughs. 
### BENEFITS BEYOND ED 

Daily tadalafil affects multiple systems. Here's what the research shows. 
#### Improved Blood Flow 

Tadalafil dilates blood vessels body-wide, not just in the penis. This systemic vasodilation improves circulation to muscles, organs, and the brain. 

- Enhanced exercise capacity and muscle perfusion 
- Better recovery after workouts 
- Improved "pump" during resistance training 
- Some evidence for improved cognitive blood flow 
#### Endothelial Function 

The endothelium (inner lining of blood vessels) is critical for cardiovascular health. Dysfunction is an early marker of atherosclerosis. 

- Improves flow-mediated dilation (FMD) 
- Increases nitric oxide bioavailability 
- May slow progression of vascular dysfunction 
- Studied in heart failure and pulmonary hypertension 
#### Prostate & Urinary Health 

Tadalafil 5mg daily is FDA-approved for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). It relaxes smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder. 

- Reduces urinary frequency and urgency 
- Improves weak stream and incomplete emptying 
- Decreases nighttime urination (nocturia) 
- Can be combined with other BPH medications 
#### Blood Pressure Effects 

Tadalafil causes mild, sustained blood pressure reduction through vasodilation. This can be beneficial or require monitoring depending on baseline. 

- Typical reduction: 3-5 mmHg systolic 
- Beneficial for mildly elevated BP 
- Requires caution with BP medications 
- **Contraindicated with nitrates **
#### Metabolic Effects 

Emerging research suggests PDE5 inhibitors may have mild metabolic benefits, possibly through improved blood flow to muscle tissue. 

- Some studies show improved insulin sensitivity 
- May improve glucose uptake in muscle 
- Effects modest but consistent in research 
- Not a primary treatment for metabolic issues 
#### Erectile Function 

The most well-known benefit. Daily dosing provides consistent support rather than timing doses around sexual activity. 

- Steady-state levels vs. peaks and troughs 
- No need to plan around taking medication 
- Can improve spontaneity 
- Often works when as-needed dosing doesn't 
### DAILY VS. AS-NEEDED DOSING 
#### Daily (2.5-5mg) 

- Taken every day, same time 
- Steady blood levels 
- Benefits for prostate, BP, endothelium 
- No timing around activity 
- Often better tolerated (fewer side effects) 
- Higher total monthly cost 
#### As-Needed (10-20mg) 

- Taken 30-60 min before activity 
- Peak levels, then decline 
- Primarily for erectile function 
- Lasts up to 36 hours per dose 
- More noticeable side effects possible 
- Lower cost if used infrequently 

**Our approach: **For men interested in the full range of benefits—prostate health, cardiovascular support, and consistent erectile function—we typically recommend daily 5mg dosing. For those primarily concerned with occasional ED, as-needed dosing may be more appropriate. 
### WHO BENEFITS MOST 
#### Good Candidates 

- Men with ED who want consistent coverage 
- Men with BPH/urinary symptoms 
- Those interested in cardiovascular support 
- Men on TRT (common combination) 
- Those with mildly elevated blood pressure 
- Active men wanting improved blood flow 
#### Not Appropriate For 

- **Anyone taking nitrates **(dangerous interaction) 
- Severe heart disease or recent cardiac event 
- Very low blood pressure 
- Certain eye conditions (NAION history) 
- Severe liver or kidney disease 
- Those on certain alpha-blockers (timing matters) 
### SIDE EFFECTS & SAFETY 

Daily low-dose tadalafil is generally well-tolerated. Side effects are usually mild and often diminish with continued use. 
#### Common (usually mild) 

- Headache (most common, often resolves) 
- Back pain or muscle aches 
- Nasal congestion 
- Flushing 
- Indigestion 
#### Rare but serious 

- Sudden vision changes (stop immediately) 
- Sudden hearing loss (stop immediately) 
- Priapism (erection >4 hours—seek care) 
- Severe hypotension (especially with nitrates) 

**Critical warning: **Never combine tadalafil with nitrates (nitroglycerin, isosorbide) or recreational drugs containing nitrates ("poppers"). This combination can cause life-threatening drops in blood pressure. 
### COMMON QUESTIONS 
#### Do I need to have ED to benefit from tadalafil? 

No. Many men take daily tadalafil primarily for prostate/urinary symptoms or cardiovascular benefits. Improved erectile function is a side benefit. It's increasingly used as part of general optimization protocols. 
#### Can I take tadalafil with testosterone? 

Yes, this is a common and effective combination. TRT addresses hormone levels; tadalafil addresses blood flow. They work through different mechanisms and complement each other well. 
#### How long does it take to work? 

For erectile function, effects can be noticed within days. For prostate symptoms, improvement typically takes 1-2 weeks. Cardiovascular and endothelial benefits develop over weeks to months of consistent use. 
#### Is generic tadalafil as effective as Cialis? 

Yes. Generic tadalafil contains the same active ingredient and is FDA-regulated for quality. It's significantly less expensive than brand-name Cialis, making daily dosing more affordable. 
#### What if I'm already on blood pressure medication? 

Tadalafil can be used with most BP medications but requires medical oversight. The combination with nitrates is absolutely contraindicated. Alpha-blockers require careful timing. We review your medications before prescribing.

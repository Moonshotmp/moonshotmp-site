## Medical Services

### Comprehensive Blood Panels — $285
60+ biomarkers analyzed including:
- Hormones: Total testosterone, free testosterone, estradiol, progesterone, DHEA-S, thyroid panel (TSH, free T3, free T4)
- Metabolic: Fasting glucose, HbA1c, insulin, lipid panel, ApoB
- Inflammation: CRP, homocysteine
- Nutrients: Vitamin D, B12, ferritin, iron panel, magnesium
- Organ function: Complete metabolic panel, liver enzymes, kidney function

Why it matters: Standard primary care panels test 10-15 markers. We test 60+ because optimization requires seeing the full picture—not just checking for disease.

### DEXA Body Composition Scan — $150
Medical-grade body composition analysis measuring:
- Total body fat percentage and distribution
- Lean muscle mass by region (arms, legs, trunk)
- Bone mineral density (osteoporosis screening)
- Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) — the dangerous fat around organs
- Android/gynoid fat ratio

Equipment: Hologic Horizon scanner (gold standard in research and clinical settings)
- 128 ceramic detectors
- OnePass fan beam technology
- Under 3 minutes for whole body scan
- Precision exceeds ISCD standards by 4x
- Supports patients up to 500 lbs

Why DEXA over InBody or home scales: DEXA is the only method that directly measures body composition with X-ray technology. Bioelectrical impedance (InBody, home scales) estimates composition based on water content and can vary 5-10% based on hydration, meals, and time of day.

### Performance Baseline Bundle — $405 (save $30)
DEXA scan + comprehensive blood panel together. Best starting point for anyone serious about optimization.

### Men's Hormone Optimization — $208/month
Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) and hormone optimization for men experiencing:
- Low energy and fatigue
- Decreased libido
- Brain fog and poor concentration
- Mood changes, irritability, depression
- Difficulty building or maintaining muscle
- Increased body fat, especially abdominal
- Poor sleep quality

What's included:
- Ongoing medical oversight and provider access
- Personalized protocol design
- 2 DEXA scans per year
- Comprehensive labs every 6 months
- 1 vitamin shot per month
- Dosing adjustments as needed

Treatment options:
- Testosterone cypionate injections
- Testosterone cream
- Enclomiphene (fertility-preserving alternative)
- HCG (for fertility preservation)

Safety monitoring: We track hematocrit, PSA, lipids, and estradiol regularly to ensure treatment remains safe.

### Women's Hormone Optimization — $208/month
Bioidentical hormone replacement therapy (BHRT) for women experiencing:
- Perimenopause and menopause symptoms
- Hot flashes, night sweats
- Sleep disturbances
- Mood changes, anxiety, depression
- Brain fog and memory issues
- Low libido
- Vaginal dryness
- Weight gain, especially around midsection
- Bone density concerns

What's included:
- Ongoing medical oversight and provider access
- Personalized protocol design
- 2 DEXA scans per year
- Comprehensive labs every 6 months
- 1 vitamin shot per month
- Dosing adjustments as needed

Treatment options:
- Estradiol (patch, cream, or pellets)
- Progesterone (oral or cream)
- Testosterone (yes, women need it too—for energy, libido, and muscle)
- DHEA
- Thyroid optimization

We use bioidentical hormones—molecularly identical to what your body produces—not synthetic versions.

### Weight Loss Program (GLP-1) — $405/month
Medical weight loss using GLP-1 medications with a focus on muscle preservation:
- Semaglutide (same active ingredient as Ozempic/Wegovy)
- Tirzepatide (same active ingredient as Mounjaro/Zepbound)

What's included:
- GLP-1 medication
- Medical oversight and provider access
- DEXA tracking to ensure you're losing fat, not muscle
- Lab monitoring
- Dosing adjustments
- Nutrition guidance

Why we track body composition: The scale doesn't tell the whole story. Rapid weight loss often includes muscle loss, which hurts metabolism and long-term health. We use DEXA to ensure you're losing fat and preserving (or building) muscle.

### Prescription + Oversight Program — $105/month
For patients whose insurance covers GLP-1 or hormone medications:
- We write the prescription and send to your pharmacy
- Medical oversight and monitoring
- Lab work as needed
- Dosing guidance
- Provider access for questions

### Peptides
Therapeutic peptides guided by labs and goals:
- BPC-157: Tissue healing, gut repair
- TB-500: Recovery, inflammation
- NAD+: Cellular energy, longevity
- Other peptides based on individual needs

### Daily Tadalafil
Daily low-dose tadalafil (2.5-5mg) for benefits beyond erectile dysfunction:
- Improved blood flow and vasodilation body-wide
- Prostate and urinary health (FDA-approved for BPH)
- Endothelial function and cardiovascular support
- Mild blood pressure reduction (3-5 mmHg)
- Emerging evidence for insulin sensitivity
- Often combined with TRT for comprehensive men's health optimization
- Contraindicated with nitrates

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General

**What makes Moonshot different from a regular doctor?**
Primary care is designed for sick care—treating problems after they appear. We focus on optimization—measuring early, identifying trends, and intervening before problems develop. We also spend more time with patients (30-60 min visits, not 7 minutes) and test far more comprehensively (60+ biomarkers vs 10-15).

**Do you accept insurance?**
- Rehab services: We accept Blue Cross Blue Shield PPO
- Medical services: Cash-pay only

Insurance doesn't cover optimization. It's designed for sick care—waiting until something is broken to act. Our goal is to take you from "normal" to optimal, not just react when there's a problem. This model lets us spend more time with you, order the right tests, and focus on what actually moves the needle.

**Do you accept HSA/FSA?**
Yes, HSA and FSA are accepted for most services.

### Hormone Therapy

**Is testosterone therapy (TRT) safe?**
When properly monitored, testosterone therapy has a strong safety profile. We monitor hematocrit, PSA, lipids, and estradiol regularly and adjust protocols as needed. The key is proper dosing and ongoing monitoring—not a prescription and a handshake.

**Will TRT affect my fertility?**
Standard TRT can suppress sperm production. If fertility is a concern, we offer protocols using HCG or enclomiphene that can help preserve fertility while optimizing hormones.

**What's the difference between TRT and enclomiphene?**
TRT replaces testosterone directly. Enclomiphene stimulates your body to produce more testosterone naturally by blocking estrogen feedback at the pituitary. Enclomiphene preserves fertility and testicular function but may not achieve the same testosterone levels as TRT. We help you decide which is right based on your goals, labs, and fertility plans.

**Is hormone replacement therapy safe for women?**
Yes, when properly prescribed and monitored. The 2002 WHI study created fear around HRT, but it studied synthetic hormones (Premarin, Provera) in older women, not bioidentical hormones in perimenopausal women. Subsequent research shows bioidentical hormones, started around menopause, are safe and protective for most women.

**Do women need testosterone?**
Yes. Women produce testosterone naturally (just less than men), and it declines with age. Low testosterone in women contributes to fatigue, low libido, difficulty building muscle, and brain fog. We prescribe it at physiologic doses appropriate for women.

### Weight Loss

**How do GLP-1 medications work?**
GLP-1s (semaglutide, tirzepatide) mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar. They reduce hunger, increase satiety, and help your body regulate blood sugar more effectively. Combined with proper nutrition and monitoring, they can produce significant, sustainable weight loss.

**Will I lose muscle on GLP-1s?**
Rapid weight loss—with or without medication—can include muscle loss. That's why we track body composition with DEXA, not just scale weight. We adjust nutrition and monitor to ensure you're losing fat while preserving muscle.

**What happens when I stop GLP-1 medication?**
Without lifestyle changes, weight often returns. That's why we focus on building sustainable habits during treatment and using DEXA to ensure you're building or maintaining muscle (which supports metabolism).

### DEXA & Labs

**How often should I get a DEXA scan?**
For most optimization patients, every 6 months is ideal to track progress. More frequently if you're making significant body composition changes. Our hormone programs include 2 DEXA scans per year.

**Why do you test so many biomarkers?**
Standard panels are designed to detect disease, not optimize health. You can be "normal" on a basic panel and still have suboptimal testosterone, elevated insulin, low vitamin D, or high ApoB—all of which affect how you feel and your long-term health. We test comprehensively because optimization requires the full picture.

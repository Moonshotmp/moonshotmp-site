                            Your quiz results highlight sexual health as a primary concern area. Libido and erectile function are among the most testosterone-sensitive systems in the body — and often the first sign of hormonal decline.

        <!-- What This Pattern Means -->
        <section class="py-16 bg-brand-light text-brand-dark">
            <div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8">
                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">WHAT THIS PATTERN MEANS</h2>
                <p class="text-brand-slate font-light mb-6">
                    Sexual function is the canary in the coal mine for hormone decline. Libido and erectile quality are among the first systems to respond when testosterone drops — often before fatigue, body composition changes, or mood shifts become noticeable. When these symptoms show up, they're telling you something upstream has changed.
                </p>
                <p class="text-brand-slate font-light mb-6">
                    This is also the most underreported symptom category in men. Most guys don't bring it up — not with their doctor, not with their partner, sometimes not even with themselves. There's a stigma around it that keeps men suffering in silence, assuming it's psychological or "just aging." In most cases, it's neither. It's physiological and measurable.
                </p>
                <p class="text-brand-slate font-light">
                    What makes this pattern especially damaging is how it compounds. Sexual dysfunction erodes confidence. That confidence loss creates relationship stress. Relationship stress elevates cortisol. Elevated cortisol further suppresses testosterone. The spiral accelerates — and without addressing the hormonal root, willpower and effort alone won't reverse it.

                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            Testosterone is the primary driver of male libido. It acts on androgen receptors in the brain to generate sexual desire — the spontaneous interest in sex that healthy men experience regularly. When T declines, desire doesn't just decrease; it can feel like it disappears entirely. This isn't a psychological problem or a relationship issue. It's a receptor signaling problem with a measurable hormonal cause.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-brand-light mb-3">Erectile Mechanism</h3>
                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            Testosterone stimulates nitric oxide production in penile tissue, which triggers the vasodilation required for erections. It also maintains neural sensitivity in erectile tissue. When T is low, nitric oxide production drops and nerve response weakens. Erectile dysfunction has multiple potential causes — vascular, neurological, psychological — but hormones are foundational. Without adequate testosterone, the downstream mechanics can't function properly.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            When testosterone is low and body fat is elevated, aromatase enzyme activity increases — converting what little testosterone you have into estradiol (estrogen). This creates a double problem: less T and more E2. Elevated estrogen relative to testosterone worsens both libido and erectile function, and can cause additional symptoms like water retention and breast tissue sensitivity. Managing this ratio is often as important as raising T itself.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="bg-white/5 border border-white/10 p-6">

                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            Here's where it gets layered. Once hormone-driven dysfunction occurs a few times, performance anxiety develops. Now you have two problems: the original hormonal deficit and a secondary psychological layer built on top of it. Men start avoiding intimacy. Confidence erodes. The anticipation of failure becomes its own trigger. Addressing the hormonal root often resolves the psychological layer naturally — but the longer it persists, the more entrenched both become.

                        Reduced morning erections are one of the most reliable early indicators of hormonal decline. Morning erections are driven by overnight testosterone peaks during REM sleep. When they decrease or disappear, it's a strong signal that your testosterone production has dropped — even before other symptoms become obvious.

                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            Yes. Testosterone supports nitric oxide production, which is essential for achieving and maintaining erections. When T levels decline, nitric oxide signaling weakens and neural sensitivity drops. While ED can have vascular or psychological components, hormones are foundational — and often the overlooked root cause.

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-brand-light mb-2">Is low libido normal with age?</h3>
                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            Some gradual decline is expected, but a significant loss of sexual interest is not inevitable. Testosterone drops roughly 1-2% per year after 30. When levels fall below your individual threshold, libido can drop noticeably. The distinction: mild changes are normal, a dramatic shift from your baseline signals something treatable.

                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            Research consistently shows that testosterone replacement therapy improves both libido and erectile function in men with documented low T. Most men notice increased desire within 3-6 weeks, with erectile improvements following over 8-12 weeks. Results are strongest when combined with cardiovascular health optimization.

                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            PDE5 inhibitors work by enhancing nitric oxide signaling — but if testosterone is too low to produce adequate nitric oxide in the first place, these medications have less to work with. Poor response to ED medication is a strong indicator that the underlying cause is hormonal rather than purely vascular. Addressing testosterone often makes these medications effective, or unnecessary altogether.

                            Most couples report meaningful improvement in intimacy after hormonal optimization. It's not just about erectile function — partners notice increased desire, initiation, confidence, and emotional presence. When the hormonal driver is restored, the psychological and relational layers often improve naturally alongside it.

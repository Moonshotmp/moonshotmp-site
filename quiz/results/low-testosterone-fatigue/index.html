        <!-- What This Pattern Means -->
        <section class="py-16 bg-brand-light text-brand-dark">

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">WHAT THIS PATTERN MEANS</h2>
                <p class="text-brand-slate font-light mb-6">
                    When energy and recovery dominate your symptom profile, it signals that your body's fundamental ability to produce and use energy is compromised. This isn't about needing more coffee or a better morning routine. It's about what's happening at the cellular level.
                </p>
                <p class="text-brand-slate font-light mb-6">
                    The energy-recovery pattern is significant because these two categories feed each other. Low energy leads to poor workouts and reduced activity. Poor recovery means your body can't rebuild from the stress it does encounter. The result is a downward spiral: you do less, recover worse, feel more tired, and do even less.
                </p>
                <p class="text-brand-slate font-light">
                    Men with this pattern typically describe it as hitting a wall. Not a sudden crash, but a slow fade — the kind where you look back and realize you've been running at 60% for months or years without understanding why.

                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            Testosterone directly regulates mitochondrial function — the energy factories inside every cell. When T levels decline, mitochondria produce less ATP (your body's energy currency). This isn't "feeling tired." It's a measurable reduction in cellular energy output that affects every system in your body.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            Testosterone stimulates erythropoiesis — the production of red blood cells. Fewer red blood cells means less oxygen delivery to muscles and organs. This creates the sensation of running out of gas during activities that used to feel easy. Some men with low T have subclinical anemia that never gets identified because no one checks their hormones.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            Testosterone is anabolic — it builds and repairs tissue. When levels are low, recovery from workouts slows, injuries linger, and your immune system underperforms. You get sick more often, take longer to bounce back, and accumulate fatigue faster than your body can clear it.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            Low testosterone disrupts sleep architecture, reducing time in deep (stage 3-4) sleep where physical restoration occurs. But here's the problem: most testosterone is produced during deep sleep. So poor sleep lowers T, and low T worsens sleep. Breaking this cycle often requires addressing the hormonal side directly.

                        Isolated fatigue can have many causes. But when fatigue pairs with slow recovery, that combination strongly implicates hormonal decline. Your body is telling you it can't produce energy efficiently AND can't repair itself adequately. Both functions require testosterone.

                <div class="space-y-6">

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-brand-light mb-2">Can low testosterone cause extreme fatigue?</h3>
                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            Yes. Testosterone directly affects mitochondrial energy production and red blood cell formation. When levels drop, cellular energy output decreases and mild anemia can develop, leading to persistent exhaustion that doesn't improve with more sleep or caffeine.

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-brand-light mb-2">Why am I tired all the time even though I sleep enough?</h3>
                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            Low testosterone disrupts sleep architecture — reducing time in deep, restorative sleep stages. You get hours of sleep but not quality sleep. Combined with reduced cellular energy production, the result is persistent fatigue no matter how many hours you're in bed.

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-brand-light mb-2">What testosterone level causes fatigue?</h3>
                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            Fatigue symptoms typically appear when total testosterone drops below 400 ng/dL, though some men notice energy issues at higher levels if free testosterone is low. Standard lab "normal" starts at 300 ng/dL, but optimal energy usually requires 500-800 ng/dL.

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-brand-light mb-2">How quickly does energy improve with testosterone treatment?</h3>
                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            Most men notice initial energy improvements within 3-4 weeks. Full energy restoration typically occurs by 8-12 weeks as red blood cell production increases and mitochondrial function normalizes.

                            A fatigue workup should include: total and free testosterone, SHBG, estradiol, complete thyroid panel (TSH, free T3, free T4), CBC, ferritin, vitamin D, B12, fasting insulin, and a comprehensive metabolic panel. Testing just total testosterone misses the picture.

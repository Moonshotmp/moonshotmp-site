This is driven by insurance guidelines and a conventional model that treats thyroid disease as binary: you either have it or you don't. But this approach misses subclinical dysfunction, T4-to-T3 conversion issues, elevated reverse T3, and thyroid antibodies (Hashimoto's). A TSH-only approach is like checking your car's oil light but never testing the oil quality, filter condition, or engine temperature. Moonshot tests the full thyroid panel — TSH, Free T4, Free T3, Reverse T3, TPO antibodies, and Thyroglobulin antibodies — because you can't optimize what you don't measure."

They tell you whether you have a diagnosable disease, not whether your thyroid is performing well. Optimal ranges are narrower and based on where patients report feeling and performing their best. For example, a TSH of 4.0 mIU/L falls within the 'normal' reference range (0.4–4.5), but most patients feel significantly better with a TSH under 2.0. The same pattern holds for Free T3, Free T4, and Reverse T3. Normal keeps you out of the emergency room. Optimal is where you actually feel good."

Hypothyroidism — even subclinical hypothyroidism — slows your basal metabolic rate, increases water retention, and impairs your body's ability to mobilize and burn fat. Overt hypothyroidism can cause 10 to 30 pounds of weight gain, and even mild thyroid underperformance (TSH in the 3–5 range) can make fat loss significantly harder despite consistent diet and exercise. This is one of the most frustrating patterns we see: patients doing everything right but unable to lose weight because their thyroid is technically 'normal' but functionally sluggish."

This gives us the complete picture: how much signal your brain is sending, how much hormone your thyroid is producing, how well you're converting it to the active form, whether it's being blocked, and whether your immune system is attacking the gland itself.

Thyroid hormone replacement — whether levothyroxine (synthetic T4), liothyronine (synthetic T3), or desiccated thyroid (Armour Thyroid, NP Thyroid) — is one of the most well-studied and commonly prescribed medication classes in medicine. It has been used safely for over 60 years. You are not adding a foreign substance to your body; you are replacing what your thyroid isn't producing enough of. The key is proper dosing and ongoing monitoring. Over-replacement can cause symptoms of hyperthyroidism (anxiety, rapid heart rate, bone loss), which is why regular lab work and clinical follow-up are essential. When dosed correctly and monitored properly, thyroid replacement is safe indefinitely."

                    <p>
                        The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland at the base of your neck, and it functions as the master regulator of your metabolism. It produces two primary hormones: thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). T4 is the storage form — it circulates in large quantities but is biologically inactive. T3 is the active form — it's what your cells actually use. About 80% of T3 is produced by converting T4 in peripheral tissues (liver, gut, kidneys, muscles), not by the thyroid gland itself. This conversion step is where a huge amount of dysfunction hides.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Every cell in your body has thyroid hormone receptors. That's not hyperbole — it's physiology. T3 enters the cell nucleus and directly regulates gene transcription. This is why thyroid dysfunction affects virtually every system in the body and why the symptom list is so broad that it gets dismissed as "stress" or "aging."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here's what thyroid hormones directly regulate:

                            T3 sets the pace at which every cell burns fuel. Low T3 means fewer calories burned at rest, lower body temperature, and a sluggish metabolism that makes fat loss feel impossible even in a calorie deficit.

                            Thyroid hormones regulate mitochondrial function and ATP production. When thyroid output is low, your cells produce less energy. The result is fatigue that sleep doesn't fix — because the problem isn't rest, it's cellular energy output.

                <div class="space-y-4 text-brand-gray font-light">
                    <p>
                        Most doctors test only TSH. Some add Free T4. That's it. This is the standard of care in conventional medicine, and it misses a staggering amount of thyroid dysfunction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) is produced by the pituitary gland. When thyroid hormone levels drop, the pituitary releases more TSH to tell the thyroid to produce more. When thyroid levels are adequate, TSH drops. It's a feedback loop — and testing TSH alone tells you what the pituitary thinks about thyroid levels. It does not tell you how much active hormone is reaching your cells, whether you're converting T4 to T3 properly, whether reverse T3 is blocking your receptors, or whether your immune system is slowly destroying the gland.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Testing only TSH is like checking the thermostat reading but never checking whether the furnace is actually producing heat, whether the ducts are open, or whether someone left a window open. The thermostat might read "fine" while you're freezing.
                    </p>

                            The pituitary's signal to the thyroid. Tells you whether the brain thinks it's getting enough thyroid hormone. Useful, but it's an indirect marker. TSH can be "normal" while Free T3 is low, Reverse T3 is high, or antibodies are elevated. It also fluctuates throughout the day (lowest in the afternoon, highest in the early morning) and is suppressed by stress, cortisol, and certain medications.

                            The unbound, available form of the storage hormone. Most T4 in your blood is bound to proteins (mainly thyroxine-binding globulin, or TBG) and is biologically inactive. Free T4 is what's available for conversion to T3. Important to measure, but T4 is not the active hormone — it has to be converted. A patient with adequate Free T4 but poor conversion will still be functionally hypothyroid.

                            The active hormone. This is what actually enters your cells, binds to nuclear receptors, and drives metabolic activity. Free T3 is arguably the single most important thyroid marker for how you actually feel and function — and it's the one most commonly left off standard panels.

                            An inactive metabolite of T4 that competes with T3 for receptor binding. Under stress, caloric restriction, inflammation, or illness, the body preferentially converts T4 to Reverse T3 instead of active T3. This is a protective mechanism — it slows metabolism when the body perceives threat. But in chronic stress, overdieting, or systemic inflammation, Reverse T3 stays elevated and effectively blocks your cells from using the T3 you do produce. High Reverse T3 with "normal" TSH and Free T4 is one of the most common patterns we see in patients who feel terrible but are told their thyroid is fine.

Elevated TPO antibodies mean your immune system is attacking your thyroid gland. The damage is gradual. TSH may remain normal for years while the gland is slowly being destroyed. By the time TSH finally rises out of range, significant gland damage has already occurred. Early detection through antibody testing allows intervention before irreversible damage.

                        Look at TSH. The standard range goes up to 4.5 mIU/L. A patient with a TSH of 4.2 will be told "your thyroid is normal." But research published in the <em>Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism</em> has shown that TSH levels above 2.5 are associated with increased risk of progression to overt hypothyroidism, and that patients with TSH in the 0.5-2.0 range report significantly better energy, mood, and cognitive function. The National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry has recommended narrowing the upper limit of the TSH reference range to 2.5 mIU/L — a recommendation that most labs and conventional practitioners still have not adopted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The same pattern holds for Free T3. A value of 2.3 pg/mL is technically "in range" but sits at the bottom — a level where most patients experience fatigue, brain fog, and difficulty with body composition. Moving that same patient to 3.2-3.8 pg/mL often resolves symptoms entirely.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Reverse T3 is especially overlooked. A value of 20 ng/dL is "normal" by most lab ranges but indicates significant T3 receptor blockade. When the Reverse T3 to Free T3 ratio is too high, you have adequate thyroid hormone production that isn't getting into cells effectively. This is functional hypothyroidism that a standard panel will never detect.

                        Thyroid dysfunction isn't one thing. It's a spectrum of patterns, each with a different root cause and requiring a different approach. Here are the most common patterns we identify and treat:

                            The classic pattern: TSH elevated above 4.5-10+ mIU/L, Free T4 and Free T3 below range. This is what standard medicine is built to catch. Symptoms are typically severe — significant fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation, depression. Treatment with thyroid hormone replacement is straightforward and universally accepted. This is the easy one. The problem is the patterns below, which are far more common and far more frequently missed.

                            TSH elevated (typically 2.5-10 mIU/L) with Free T4 still in range. Conventional medicine debates whether this needs treatment. The data is clear: subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with increased cardiovascular risk (Rodondi et al., 2010, JAMA), progression to overt hypothyroidism (Vanderpump et al., 1995), impaired cognitive function, and symptoms that reduce quality of life. A meta-analysis by Razvi et al. (2008) in the <em>Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism</em> showed that treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism improved lipid profiles, cardiac function, and symptom scores. Waiting for it to get worse is not a strategy.

                            The most common cause of hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient countries. Elevated TPO and/or Thyroglobulin antibodies indicate the immune system is attacking and gradually destroying thyroid tissue. The insidious part: TSH and thyroid hormones can remain "normal" for years while the gland is under active autoimmune attack. By the time TSH rises out of range, 50-80% of functional thyroid tissue may already be destroyed. Early detection through antibody testing allows intervention with lifestyle, nutrition, and immune-modulating strategies before irreversible gland loss. Hashimoto's affects up to 5% of the population and is 5-8 times more common in women.

                            TSH and Free T4 are normal, but Free T3 is low. The thyroid is producing adequate T4, but the body isn't converting it to the active T3 form efficiently. Conversion depends on the enzyme 5'-deiodinase, which requires <a href="/learn/vitamin-d-micronutrients/" class="text-brand-gray underline decoration-brand-gray/30 hover:decoration-brand-gray transition-colors">selenium, zinc, and iron</a> as cofactors, and is impaired by chronic stress (elevated cortisol), inflammation, gut dysfunction, caloric restriction, and certain medications. This pattern is extremely common in patients under chronic stress or those who have been aggressively dieting. Standard treatment with levothyroxine (T4 only) won't fix this — you're adding more of the hormone the body can't convert. These patients often need direct T3 supplementation or combination therapy.

                            Reverse T3 is elevated, effectively blocking T3 receptors even when Free T3 is adequate. Common triggers: chronic physiological or psychological stress, caloric restriction or prolonged fasting, systemic inflammation, chronic illness, and iron deficiency. The body is diverting T4 to the inactive pathway instead of the active one. This is a protective mechanism — the body is downregulating metabolism because it perceives a threat. The fix requires addressing the root cause (stress, inflammation, nutritional deficiency) in addition to potential medication adjustments.

                            Thyroid function doesn't exist in isolation. Estrogen increases thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), which binds more T4 and T3, reducing the amount of free (usable) hormone available. This is why women on oral estrogen (birth control pills, oral HRT) frequently develop thyroid symptoms — their total thyroid hormone may be adequate, but free hormone levels drop. Conversely, hypothyroidism increases SHBG and alters estrogen/progesterone ratios. Testosterone replacement can also affect thyroid-binding proteins. This is why hormone optimization requires looking at the entire endocrine system, not one axis at a time.

                <div class="space-y-4 text-brand-gray font-light">
                    <p>
                        Thyroid optimization at Moonshot isn't a standalone protocol. It's part of a comprehensive approach to endocrine and metabolic health. The thyroid doesn't exist in isolation — it's regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis, influenced by cortisol (HPA axis), affected by sex hormones, and dependent on nutritional cofactors. We treat the system, not just the gland.
                    </p>

                            Full thyroid panel: TSH, Free T4, Free T3, Reverse T3, TPO antibodies, and Thyroglobulin antibodies. We also assess related markers: fasting insulin, inflammatory markers (hs-CRP, ferritin), iron studies (ferritin, serum iron, TIBC), vitamin D, selenium, zinc, and cortisol. These cofactors directly impact thyroid production, conversion, and receptor sensitivity. Without them, you're treating a symptom while the root cause persists.

                            Numbers don't exist in a vacuum. A TSH of 1.5 in a 30-year-old with severe fatigue, weight gain, elevated TPO antibodies, and a Free T3 of 2.2 is not "fine." We interpret labs in the context of your symptoms, medical history, other hormone levels, body composition goals, and overall clinical picture. The question isn't "is this in range?" The question is "is this optimal for this patient?"

                            Treatment is individualized based on the specific pattern of dysfunction. Options include: <strong class="text-brand-light">Levothyroxine (synthetic T4)</strong> — the standard first-line treatment; provides T4 that the body converts to T3. Works well for patients with intact conversion capacity. <strong class="text-brand-light">Liothyronine (synthetic T3)</strong> — direct T3 replacement, used when conversion is impaired or when patients don't respond adequately to T4 alone. Often added to levothyroxine as combination therapy. <strong class="text-brand-light">Desiccated thyroid (Armour Thyroid, NP Thyroid)</strong> — derived from porcine thyroid glands, contains both T4 and T3 in a physiologic ratio. Some patients prefer desiccated thyroid and report better symptom resolution compared to synthetic T4 alone. <strong class="text-brand-light">Nutritional optimization</strong> — correcting selenium, zinc, iron, iodine, and vitamin D deficiencies that impair thyroid function. <strong class="text-brand-light">Lifestyle modification</strong> — addressing chronic stress, <a href="/learn/sleep-optimization/" class="text-brand-gray underline decoration-brand-gray/30 hover:decoration-brand-gray transition-colors">sleep</a>, gut health, and inflammatory triggers that suppress thyroid function.

                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            Thyroid optimization isn't "prescribe and forget." We recheck labs 6-8 weeks after initiation or dose changes (the time required for thyroid levels to reach steady state), then every 3-6 months once stable. Dosing is adjusted based on labs and symptoms — the goal is how you feel and function, not just where the numbers land. We also monitor for signs of over-replacement (resting heart rate, anxiety, bone density considerations) to ensure the dose stays in the therapeutic sweet spot.

                        <p class="text-brand-slate font-light text-sm">
                            Most standard panels only test TSH, and sometimes Free T4. This is driven by insurance guidelines and a conventional model that treats thyroid disease as binary: you either have it or you don't. But this approach misses subclinical dysfunction, T4-to-T3 conversion issues, elevated reverse T3, and thyroid antibodies (Hashimoto's). A TSH-only approach is like checking your car's oil light but never testing the oil quality, filter condition, or engine temperature. Moonshot tests the full thyroid panel — TSH, Free T4, Free T3, Reverse T3, TPO antibodies, and Thyroglobulin antibodies — because you can't optimize what you don't measure.

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-brand-dark mb-2">What's the difference between normal and optimal thyroid levels?</h3>
                        <p class="text-brand-slate font-light text-sm">
                            Normal reference ranges are derived from population averages — which include sick, sedentary, and metabolically unhealthy people. They tell you whether you have a diagnosable disease, not whether your thyroid is performing well. Optimal ranges are narrower and based on where patients report feeling and performing their best. For example, a TSH of 4.0 mIU/L falls within the "normal" reference range (0.4-4.5), but most patients feel significantly better with a TSH under 2.0. The same pattern holds for Free T3, Free T4, and Reverse T3. Normal keeps you out of the emergency room. Optimal is where you actually feel good.

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-brand-dark mb-2">Can thyroid problems cause weight gain?</h3>
                        <p class="text-brand-slate font-light text-sm">
                            Yes. Hypothyroidism — even subclinical hypothyroidism — slows your basal metabolic rate, increases water retention, and impairs your body's ability to mobilize and burn fat. Overt hypothyroidism can cause 10 to 30 pounds of weight gain, and even mild thyroid underperformance (TSH in the 3-5 range) can make fat loss significantly harder despite consistent diet and exercise. This is one of the most frustrating patterns we see: patients doing everything right but unable to lose weight because their thyroid is technically "normal" but functionally sluggish.

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-brand-dark mb-2">What does Moonshot's thyroid panel include?</h3>
                        <p class="text-brand-slate font-light text-sm">
                            Our full thyroid panel includes: TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone), Free T4 (the inactive storage form), Free T3 (the active hormone your cells actually use), Reverse T3 (an inactive metabolite that blocks T3 receptors), TPO antibodies (thyroid peroxidase antibodies — the primary marker for Hashimoto's thyroiditis), and Thyroglobulin antibodies (another autoimmune marker). This gives us the complete picture: how much signal your brain is sending, how much hormone your thyroid is producing, how well you're converting it to the active form, whether it's being blocked, and whether your immune system is attacking the gland itself. A TSH-only test gives you one data point out of six.

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-brand-dark mb-2">Is thyroid medication safe long-term?</h3>
                        <p class="text-brand-slate font-light text-sm">
                            Yes. Thyroid hormone replacement — whether levothyroxine (synthetic T4), liothyronine (synthetic T3), or desiccated thyroid (Armour Thyroid, NP Thyroid) — is one of the most well-studied and commonly prescribed medication classes in medicine. It has been used safely for over 60 years. You are not adding a foreign substance to your body; you are replacing what your thyroid isn't producing enough of. The key is proper dosing and ongoing monitoring. Over-replacement can cause symptoms of hyperthyroidism (anxiety, rapid heart rate, bone loss), which is why regular lab work and clinical follow-up are essential. When dosed correctly and monitored properly, thyroid replacement is safe indefinitely.

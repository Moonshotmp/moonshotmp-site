                    Extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) delivers acoustic pressure waves through the skin into damaged tissue--restarting your body's healing response where it stalled.

                        <p class="text-brand-slate text-sm font-light">
                            Shockwave technology was developed in the 1980s to break up kidney stones without surgery. Physicians noticed patients also showed accelerated tissue healing near the treatment site. Decades of research followed, and ESWT is now one of the most evidence-backed non-invasive treatments for chronic musculoskeletal injuries.

                        <p class="text-brand-slate text-sm font-light">
                            Chronic tendon injuries don't heal on their own because the initial inflammatory phase--the one that kicks off repair--either never fully activates or stalls out. Blood supply to tendons is already limited. Rest alone rarely fixes the problem. You're not dealing with acute inflammation anymore. You're dealing with failed healing.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-brand-slate text-sm font-light">
                            Shockwave deliberately restarts the stalled healing process. The acoustic waves create controlled mechanical stress at the cellular level, stimulating neovascularization (new blood vessels), releasing growth factors like eNOS, VEGF, and BMP, breaking down calcifications, and disrupting pain signaling via substance P depletion. <a href="/learn/shockwave-therapy/" class="text-brand-slate underline decoration-brand-slate/30 hover:decoration-brand-slate transition-colors">Read the full science</a>.

                    ESWT is most effective for chronic tendon injuries that haven't responded to rest, physical therapy, or injections. These are the conditions we treat most frequently in Park Ridge.

                        <p class="text-brand-gray text-xs font-light">The single most common and most studied indication for shockwave therapy. Systematic reviews show 65-80% of patients achieve significant pain reduction. If you've had heel pain for months and rest hasn't fixed it, ESWT is a first-line option before considering surgery.</p>

                        <p class="text-brand-gray text-xs font-light">Both insertional and mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy respond well to shockwave. Particularly valuable for insertional cases where eccentric loading exercises--the standard rehab approach--are often less effective on their own.</p>

                        <p class="text-brand-gray text-xs font-light">Chronic tennis elbow that hasn't responded to bracing or therapy is a strong candidate. Studies show 60-75% improvement rates.

                                    Most conditions require 3-6 sessions spaced one week apart. The one-week interval is important--it gives the tissue time to initiate the healing response before the next round of stimulation. Your provider assesses your response after each session and adjusts accordingly.

                                    Don't expect instant results. Shockwave initiates a healing process that takes time. Most patients notice improvement after the second or third session. Full effects develop over 6-12 weeks as tissue remodels. The results are durable because you're healing the tissue, not just masking the pain.

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-brand-light mb-2">Is shockwave therapy the same as ultrasound?</h3>
                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            No. Therapeutic ultrasound delivers low-intensity continuous sound waves primarily for warming tissue. Shockwave therapy delivers high-energy acoustic pressure waves that create controlled mechanical stress at the cellular level--triggering neovascularization, growth factor release, and a genuine biological healing response. They are fundamentally different treatments with different mechanisms and different evidence bases.

                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            The ideal candidate has a chronic tendon injury (typically 3+ months) that hasn't resolved with rest, physical therapy, or other conservative treatment. Plantar fasciitis, Achilles tendinopathy, tennis/golfer's elbow, patellar tendinopathy, calcific tendinitis, and hip bursitis are the most responsive conditions. If you've been dealing with the same pain for months and nothing has worked, you're likely a good candidate.

                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            Shockwave therapy works by deliberately triggering an inflammatory healing response in tissue that stopped healing on its own. Anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs like ibuprofen and naproxen) suppress that exact response. Taking them after treatment undermines the mechanism that makes shockwave effective. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is fine because it reduces pain without suppressing inflammation.

                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            In many cases, yes. For conditions like chronic plantar fasciitis, shockwave success rates are comparable to surgical outcomes but without the incision, anesthesia, recovery time, or surgical risks. Most orthopedic guidelines now recommend trying ESWT before considering surgery for chronic tendinopathies. If shockwave doesn't provide adequate relief after a full course, surgery remains an option.

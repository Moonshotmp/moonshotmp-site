                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-8">THE BASICS</h2>
                <div class="space-y-4 text-brand-slate font-light">
                    <p>
                        Women produce testosterone. Not as much as men—roughly 1/10th to 1/20th the amount—but it's not a trace hormone. In fact, women produce more testosterone than estrogen throughout most of their lives.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Testosterone is made in the ovaries and adrenal glands. After <a href="/learn/menopause-perimenopause/" class="text-brand-slate underline decoration-brand-slate/30 hover:decoration-brand-slate transition-colors">menopause</a>, the ovaries continue to produce some testosterone even after estrogen production drops dramatically.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here's the problem: testosterone levels decline gradually starting in the 20s. By the time a woman reaches her 40s, she may have half the testosterone she had at 20. This decline continues through menopause and beyond.
                    </p>

                        <strong class="text-brand-light">Key point:</strong> Many symptoms attributed to estrogen deficiency in menopause—fatigue, low libido, brain fog, muscle loss—are actually related to testosterone deficiency. But testosterone is rarely tested or addressed.

                            Testosterone affects mitochondrial function—the energy factories in your cells. Low T often manifests as persistent fatigue that <a href="/learn/sleep-optimization/" class="text-brand-gray underline decoration-brand-gray/30 hover:decoration-brand-gray transition-colors">sleep</a> doesn't fix.

                            Testosterone is the primary driver of sexual desire in women. Low libido in menopause is often testosterone-related, not estrogen-related.
                        </p>

                            Testosterone affects dopamine and other neurotransmitters. Low T can cause depression, anxiety, loss of motivation, and decreased sense of wellbeing.

                            Testosterone is anabolic—it helps build and maintain muscle. Without adequate T, maintaining muscle mass becomes increasingly difficult.
                        </p>

                            Low testosterone promotes fat storage, especially abdominal fat. The "middle-age spread" isn't inevitable—it's often hormonal.

                <div class="space-y-6">

                            In the US, there's no testosterone product approved specifically for women. This makes many doctors hesitant to prescribe it, even though off-label use is common and products exist in other countries (Australia, UK, Europe).

                    </div>

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-brand-light mb-2">Lack of Research Funding</h3>
                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            Without an approvable drug, pharmaceutical companies haven't funded large trials. The research that does exist is largely positive, but it's smaller in scale than estrogen research.

                            "Testosterone is for men" is deeply ingrained. Many women (and doctors) worry about masculinizing effects that don't occur at physiological female doses.

                    A thin filament needle, a dysfunctional trigger point, and a twitch response that resets the tissue. No medication injected. That's it.

                <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-8">

                        <p class="text-brand-slate text-sm font-light mb-3">
                            A thin, solid monofilament needle is inserted directly into a myofascial trigger point — a hyperirritable spot within a taut band of skeletal muscle. The needle is "dry" because nothing is injected. No medication, no saline, no anesthetic. The needle itself is the treatment.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-brand-slate text-sm font-light mb-3">
                            When the needle hits the trigger point, it elicits a local twitch response — a brief, involuntary contraction that releases the sustained shortening in the muscle. This resets the neuromuscular environment, restores blood flow, normalizes the chemical milieu of the tissue, and reduces pain.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-brand-slate text-sm font-light">
                            <strong class="text-brand-dark">The result:</strong> Reduced pain, restored range of motion, and improved muscle function — often within a single session. <a href="/learn/dry-needling/" class="text-brand-slate underline decoration-brand-slate/30 hover:decoration-brand-slate transition-colors">Read our full dry needling guide</a>.

                    If your pain involves a myofascial trigger point — a taut band in the muscle that won't release — dry needling can address it directly at the tissue level.
                </p>

                <div class="grid md:grid-cols-3 gap-6">

                            Upper trapezius, levator scapulae, and scalene trigger points are among the most responsive to dry needling. Desk work, posture, and stress make these common.

                            Trigger points in the upper trapezius, suboccipitals, and temporalis are well-documented sources of referred headache pain. Dry needling can reduce frequency and intensity.

                                    The needle is extremely thin (0.16-0.30 mm) — much thinner than a hypodermic needle used for injections. Most patients barely feel the insertion. What you will feel is the local twitch response: a brief, involuntary muscle contraction that confirms the needle has hit the trigger point. It lasts a fraction of a second and feels like a deep cramp or flick. That twitch is both diagnostic and therapeutic — it means the taut band is releasing.

                                    Many patients notice improved range of motion and reduced pain immediately after the needles are removed. You may feel a sense of heaviness or relaxation in the treated area — the muscle has released a contraction it may have been holding for weeks or months.

                                    Post-treatment soreness is normal — it feels like the deep ache after a hard workout, not sharp pain. This resolves within 24 to 48 hours. Stay hydrated, move gently, and apply heat if sore. Avoid intense exercise targeting the treated muscles for 24 hours. Most patients see meaningful improvement within 1-2 sessions. You'll know within 2-3 sessions whether dry needling is the right approach for your condition.

                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            No. They use similar needles, but the framework is entirely different. Dry needling is based on modern neuroscience and musculoskeletal anatomy — the needle targets identifiable trigger points to elicit a twitch response and release the taut band. Acupuncture is based on Traditional Chinese Medicine meridian theory. Different training, different point selection, different clinical goals. <a href="/learn/dry-needling/" class="text-brand-gray underline decoration-brand-gray/30 hover:decoration-brand-gray transition-colors">Read our full comparison</a>.

                            Many patients notice improved range of motion and reduced pain immediately after a session. For lasting results, 1-2 sessions are often effective for acute issues. You'll know within 2-3 sessions whether dry needling is the right approach for your specific condition. Chronic issues may require more sessions.

                            The needle insertion itself is barely noticeable — the needles are extremely thin (0.16-0.30 mm), much thinner than a hypodermic needle. What you'll feel is the local twitch response: a brief, involuntary muscle contraction that feels like a deep cramp or flick inside the muscle. It lasts a fraction of a second. Post-treatment soreness similar to a hard workout is normal for 24-48 hours.

                            Yes — and it often works best that way. At Moonshot, dry needling is part of an integrated approach that may include <a href="/rehab/chiropractic/" class="text-brand-gray underline decoration-brand-gray/30 hover:decoration-brand-gray transition-colors">chiropractic adjustments</a>, manual therapy, corrective exercise, and <a href="/learn/trigger-point-injections/" class="text-brand-gray underline decoration-brand-gray/30 hover:decoration-brand-gray transition-colors">trigger point injections</a>. The needling resets the dysfunctional tissue; the complementary treatments reinforce proper movement and address underlying biomechanical issues.

                    <p>
                        NAD+ stands for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. It is a coenzyme found in every living cell in your body. Without it, you would be dead in about 30 seconds. That is not hyperbole. NAD+ is required for the most fundamental metabolic processes that keep cells alive and functioning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        NAD+ exists in two forms: NAD+ (the oxidized form) and NADH (the reduced form). The ratio between these two forms drives some of the most critical biochemical reactions in your body. When NAD+ accepts electrons during metabolic reactions, it becomes NADH. When NADH donates those electrons (primarily in the mitochondrial electron transport chain), it becomes NAD+ again. This cycling is the engine of cellular energy production.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But NAD+ is not just an energy molecule. It is a master regulator involved in at least five critical cellular functions:

                                NAD+ is a required substrate in glycolysis, the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle), and the electron transport chain. These are the pathways that convert the food you eat into ATP, the energy currency of every cell. Without adequate NAD+, these pathways slow down. The result is reduced ATP output, which manifests as fatigue, poor exercise recovery, and diminished cellular function across every organ system.

                                Sirtuins (SIRT1-7) are a family of enzymes that regulate gene expression, inflammation, stress resistance, and cellular repair. They are sometimes called "longevity genes" because their activation is associated with lifespan extension in animal models. Here is the critical point: sirtuins are NAD+-dependent enzymes. They literally cannot function without NAD+ as a co-substrate. When NAD+ levels drop, sirtuin activity drops with it. This is one of the proposed mechanisms linking NAD+ decline to accelerated aging.

                                PARP enzymes (poly ADP-ribose polymerases) are the frontline repair crews for DNA damage. Every day, your cells sustain tens of thousands of DNA lesions from normal metabolic activity, UV exposure, oxidative stress, and environmental toxins. PARP enzymes detect and repair this damage. Like sirtuins, PARPs require NAD+ to function. When NAD+ is depleted, DNA repair capacity declines. Accumulated unrepaired DNA damage is a hallmark of aging and a driver of cancer risk.

                                NAD+ levels oscillate in a 24-hour cycle, and this oscillation is tightly linked to circadian clock gene expression. SIRT1 (NAD+-dependent) directly interacts with the core circadian machinery, including CLOCK and BMAL1. Declining NAD+ disrupts this interplay, contributing to the sleep disturbances, altered metabolism, and impaired recovery commonly seen with aging. It is a feedback loop: poor circadian function further impairs NAD+ synthesis, and low NAD+ further disrupts the clock.

                                NAD+ is involved in the synthesis of neurotransmitters and in immune cell signaling through CD38 and CD157 enzymes. CD38, in particular, is one of the largest consumers of NAD+ in the body, and its expression increases with age and chronic inflammation. This creates a vicious cycle: inflammation increases CD38 activity, which depletes NAD+, which impairs the cellular repair and immune regulation that would resolve the inflammation.

        <!-- Why Injectable vs Oral -->

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-light mb-8">WHY INJECTABLE VS. ORAL</h2>
                <div class="space-y-4 text-brand-gray font-light">
                    <p>
                        The supplement industry sells billions of dollars of oral NAD+ precursors every year. NMN (nicotinamide mononucleotide) and NR (nicotinamide riboside) are the most popular. They are legitimate molecules with real science behind them. But there is a bioavailability problem that most marketing conveniently ignores.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When you take oral NAD+ directly, most of it is broken down in the gastrointestinal tract before it ever reaches your bloodstream. The molecule is too large and too unstable to survive gastric acid and intestinal enzymes intact. Oral NMN and NR fare better because they are smaller precursor molecules that the body can convert into NAD+ after absorption. But even here, the conversion is multi-step and inefficient. You absorb a fraction of what you swallow, and then that fraction has to go through hepatic first-pass metabolism and enzymatic conversion before it becomes usable NAD+ in your cells.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Injectable NAD+ bypasses all of this. The full dose enters the bloodstream directly, skipping the gastrointestinal tract, skipping first-pass liver metabolism, and delivering NAD+ to tissues at concentrations that oral supplementation simply cannot achieve.

                            Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) oral absorption requires intrinsic factor, a protein produced by parietal cells in the stomach. Approximately 15% of the general population has some degree of intrinsic factor deficiency. Patients on metformin (common in diabetes and increasingly used off-label) have reduced B12 absorption. Patients with any GI dysfunction, inflammatory bowel conditions, or history of gastric surgery may absorb a fraction of oral B12. Injectable B12 bypasses all of these variables.

                        <strong class="text-brand-light">An important caveat:</strong> Not everything needs to be injected. If you have normal gut function and adequate intrinsic factor, oral B12 supplementation works fine. If you eat a nutrient-dense diet, you may not need supplemental injections at all. Injectable delivery makes the most sense for nutrients where oral absorption is the documented bottleneck, or for patients with known absorption issues. This is targeted intervention, not a blanket replacement for oral supplementation.

                        Honesty matters here. NAD+ science is one of the most active areas of aging research, with legitimate, well-funded labs producing real data. But the field is at different stages of maturity depending on what you are looking at. Here is a straightforward assessment of where the evidence stands.

                            This is well-established. Multiple studies have documented the age-related decline of NAD+ in human tissues. Massudi et al. (2012) demonstrated declining NAD+ levels in human skin tissue with age. Camacho-Pereira et al. (2016) identified CD38 as a primary driver of age-related NAD+ depletion. Zhu et al. (2015) confirmed the relationship between NAD+ decline and mitochondrial dysfunction. The "what" is not in question. NAD+ goes down as you get older, and this decline correlates with impaired cellular function.

                            Animal data is robust. Rajman, Chwalek, and Sinclair (2018) published a comprehensive review in <em>Cell Metabolism</em> documenting how NAD+ boosting in mice reverses mitochondrial dysfunction, improves metabolic function, extends lifespan, and protects against neurodegeneration. Yoshino et al. (2011, 2018) demonstrated that NMN supplementation in mice reverses age-associated metabolic decline, improves insulin sensitivity, and restores mitochondrial function. Mills et al. (2016) showed long-term NMN administration mitigated age-associated physiological decline in mice without toxicity.

                            This is where you need to be realistic. Human clinical trial data is accumulating but not yet definitive for many of the claimed benefits. Yoshino et al. (2021) published a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in <em>Science</em> showing that NMN supplementation increased NAD+ metabolites and improved muscle insulin sensitivity in prediabetic postmenopausal women. Liao et al. (2021) demonstrated that NR supplementation safely elevated NAD+ levels in middle-aged and older adults. Several Phase I and Phase II trials are ongoing for NAD+ precursors in aging, neurodegeneration, and metabolic disease. The safety profile is favorable. The efficacy data for specific clinical endpoints is still being built.

We believe the mechanistic rationale is strong enough to offer NAD+ therapy to appropriate patients, while being transparent that the field is still maturing. This is not "proven to reverse aging." It is a biologically plausible intervention with a favorable safety profile and accumulating evidence. That is an honest framing.

                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) is a coenzyme in every living cell. It is essential for energy production (mitochondrial function), DNA repair, gene expression regulation (sirtuins), and cellular signaling. Levels decline 50%+ by age 60. Low NAD+ means impaired energy, slower recovery, and accelerated aging at the cellular level.

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-brand-light mb-2">Why inject instead of taking a pill?</h3>
                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            Oral NAD+ supplements have very poor bioavailability. Most is broken down in the gut before reaching cells. Injectable NAD+ bypasses digestion entirely, delivering the full dose directly to the bloodstream. The same logic applies to B12: oral absorption depends on intrinsic factor and gut health, which many people have issues with. Injectable delivery solves the absorption bottleneck.

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-brand-light mb-2">Who benefits most from NAD+ injections?</h3>
                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            People experiencing fatigue, slow recovery from exercise, brain fog, or signs of accelerated aging. Athletes looking to optimize recovery. Patients on hormone therapy, since NAD+ supports the metabolic pathways that hormones activate. Anyone over 40 with declining energy that is not explained by other factors.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-brand-light mb-2">How often should I get NAD+ injections?</h3>
                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            Typical protocol is 1-2x per week during an initial loading phase (2-4 weeks), then 1x weekly or biweekly for maintenance. Some patients transition to monthly maintenance once they have reached their goals. At Moonshot, hormone optimization members get 1 vitamin injection per month included in their membership.

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-brand-light mb-2">Are there side effects?</h3>
                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            NAD+ injections can cause flushing, warmth, mild nausea, or chest tightness during the injection. This is temporary and resolves within minutes. Slowing the injection rate reduces these effects significantly. B12 injections have minimal side effects beyond occasional soreness at the injection site. Both have favorable safety profiles when administered by trained providers.

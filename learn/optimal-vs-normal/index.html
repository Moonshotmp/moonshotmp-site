                        You go to the doctor because you're exhausted, gaining weight, losing motivation, and can't think clearly. They run bloodwork. A few days later: "Everything looks normal." End of conversation.

                            Labs collect results from a large reference population. This population includes healthy people, sick people, people on medications, sedentary people, elderly people—essentially everyone who got that test done.

                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            The reference range is defined as the middle 95% of results (2 standard deviations from the mean). The top 2.5% and bottom 2.5% are cut off and flagged as "abnormal."

                            If your result falls within that range, it's reported as normal. If it falls outside, it gets flagged. Your doctor reviews flagged values. Unflagged values are usually not discussed.

It doesn't mean optimal. And because the reference population includes unhealthy people, the range is wider than it should be. A 45-year-old man with a testosterone of 310 ng/dL is "normal" by lab standards—but that same level is associated with fatigue, low libido, brain fog, and metabolic decline.

                            TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) is the standard thyroid screening test—and one of the most frustrating. A TSH of 4.0 is "normal" but can cause fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, hair loss, and depression. Many endocrinologists now agree that TSH above 2.5 warrants investigation, especially if symptoms are present. And TSH alone doesn't tell the full story—Free T3 and Free T4 matter too.

                            This one is critical—and most doctors don't even order it. Fasting insulin above 10 suggests your body is working overtime to manage blood sugar, even if your glucose looks fine. By the time glucose goes abnormal, insulin resistance has been building for years. Fasting insulin is an early warning system for metabolic disease. A level of 20 is "normal" but screaming that something is wrong.

Suboptimal thyroid, borderline testosterone, low-normal iron, or creeping insulin resistance can each cause real symptoms. Together, they compound.

But it tells you that immune function, mood, and bone health are compromised. Optimal ranges function as an early warning system.

                            A single lab draw is a snapshot. We track trends over time—how markers respond to treatment, how they shift with lifestyle changes, and whether you're moving toward or away from optimal. This is how you actually manage health, not just check boxes.

                            Don't accept "everything's normal." Ask for a copy of your results—you're entitled to them. Look at the actual values, not just the in-range/out-of-range flags.

                        <p class="text-brand-slate text-sm font-light">
                            Request: total and free testosterone (yes, even women), full thyroid panel (TSH + Free T3 + Free T4), fasting insulin (not just glucose), vitamin D, ferritin, and hs-CRP. Most doctors will order these if you ask.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-brand-slate text-sm font-light">
                            Use the ranges in this article as a starting point. If your values are "normal" but fall in the symptomatic zones described above, that's worth a conversation with a provider who takes optimization seriously.

                        <p class="text-brand-slate text-sm font-light">
                            Get labs done at regular intervals (every 3-6 months if actively optimizing, annually at minimum). Compare your results over time. A testosterone dropping from 550 to 380 over two years is a meaningful trend—even though both are "normal."

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-brand-light mb-2">Is this just "functional medicine" / alternative medicine?</h3>
                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            No. Optimal ranges aren't fringe—they're based on the same peer-reviewed research that informs conventional medicine. The difference is in how the data is applied. We use the same evidence base; we just set the bar at "where health outcomes are best," not "where disease is absent." Many endocrinologists, cardiologists, and sports medicine doctors use these tighter ranges in their practice.

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-brand-light mb-2">Will my insurance cover the additional tests?</h3>
                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            It depends on the test and your insurance. Basic hormones, thyroid panels, and metabolic markers are typically covered, especially with appropriate diagnostic codes. Some specialized markers may not be. At Moonshot, our comprehensive panel is included in your membership—no insurance hassle.

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-brand-light mb-2">How often should I get labs done?</h3>
                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            If you're starting a new treatment (hormone therapy, weight loss, etc.): every 6-8 weeks initially, then every 3-6 months once stable. For general health monitoring: every 6-12 months. If something was flagged as suboptimal and you made changes: recheck in 8-12 weeks to see if it moved.

                            Yes, there's a point of diminishing returns. The goal is informed decision-making, not obsessive tracking. A comprehensive panel 2-4 times per year gives you the data you need. What matters is acting on the data—not just collecting it.

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-8">WHAT ARE PEPTIDES?</h2>
                <div class="space-y-4 text-brand-slate font-light">
                    <p>
                        Peptides are short chains of amino acids. Think of amino acids as letters and peptides as words—short sequences that carry a specific message. Proteins are the full sentences and paragraphs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Technically, a peptide is any chain of 2 to about 50 amino acids. Above that, it's generally called a protein. Your body makes thousands of peptides naturally—insulin is a peptide, oxytocin is a peptide, the endorphins you feel after a workout are peptides.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Therapeutic peptides are lab-made versions of these natural signaling molecules. They work by binding to specific receptors in your body and triggering a targeted response: release more growth hormone, repair gut tissue, increase blood flow, reduce inflammation. The specificity is the appeal—peptides can do one thing precisely, with fewer off-target effects than broad-acting drugs.
                    </p>

                            Scientists developed synthetic peptides that could stimulate the pituitary gland to release growth hormone. This led to compounds like GHRP-6, GHRP-2, and eventually sermorelin—the first FDA-approved growth hormone releasing peptide (approved in 1997 as Geref).

                            Dr. Predrag Sikiric's lab in Zagreb, Croatia began publishing research on BPC-157 (Body Protection Compound), a peptide derived from a protective protein found in gastric juice. Over 100 studies followed—mostly animal models—showing remarkable healing properties for tendons, ligaments, gut, and muscle. It became arguably the most popular peptide in the optimization world.

                                <strong class="text-brand-dark">What it does:</strong> Sermorelin is a growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) analog. It stimulates your pituitary gland to produce and release more of your own growth hormone, particularly during sleep. Benefits include improved sleep quality, body composition, recovery, skin elasticity, and overall vitality.

                    <p>
                        Here's a pattern that repeats across the peptide landscape: a compound shows real promise in early trials, then disappears from the clinical pipeline. People assume this means it didn't work. Usually, it means nobody could fund what comes next.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Getting a drug through FDA approval costs $1-2 billion on average and takes 10-15 years. For a pharmaceutical company, that investment only makes sense if they can patent the compound and recoup costs through exclusive sales.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Peptides present a problem: many are naturally occurring or simple enough that strong patent protection is difficult. If you spend $1 billion getting BPC-157 through Phase III trials and FDA approval, a compounding pharmacy can immediately make a generic version. The economics don't work for traditional pharma.

                    <p>
                        Search "BPC-157" online and you'll find dozens of websites selling peptides. Most display a disclaimer: "For research purposes only. Not for human consumption." This is how they operate in a legal gray area.

                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            Licensed compounding pharmacies operate under FDA oversight with strict manufacturing standards (cGMP or comparable). Research chemical companies don't. There's no required testing for purity, potency, sterility, or endotoxins. Quality varies wildly between companies—and between batches from the same company.

                            Third-party testing of "research" peptides has found: wrong peptide entirely, incorrect concentrations (sometimes 50% under or over), bacterial endotoxins, heavy metal contamination, and residual solvents from manufacturing. When you inject something, you need to know exactly what it is. These products don't give you that certainty.

                            Research chemical companies can't legally provide dosing instructions for human use. So people piece together protocols from Reddit threads, YouTube videos, and forum posts. This is how you get wrong doses, wrong injection sites, wrong reconstitution methods, and wrong frequency. Peptide dosing matters—too little does nothing, too much causes side effects.

                            Nobody is monitoring your labs, watching for interactions with other medications, checking for contraindications, or adjusting your protocol based on response.

                        <p class="text-brand-slate font-light text-sm">
                            No. Steroids are synthetic hormones (typically testosterone derivatives) that directly supply the hormone. Peptides are signaling molecules that tell your body to do something—like produce more growth hormone. They work through different mechanisms and have very different risk profiles.

                        <p class="text-brand-slate font-light text-sm">
                            When sourced from a licensed pharmacy and used under medical supervision with proper dosing, peptides like sermorelin and PT-141 have good safety profiles. The risk increases dramatically when using unregulated "research" products without medical oversight. Safety is a function of the compound, the source, and the supervision.

                        <p class="text-brand-slate font-light text-sm">
                            It's possible. The FDA has said it will revisit decisions as new data becomes available. If a peptide completes adequate clinical trials or if Congress changes compounding laws, some compounds could return to compounding eligibility. But there's no timeline, and it would require significant effort and investment to make it happen.

                        <p class="text-brand-slate font-light text-sm">
                            Most peptides are broken down by digestive enzymes before they can be absorbed, which is why most are injected. Some companies sell oral peptide "supplements"—these are generally not effective for the same reasons. There are exceptions (BPC-157 was originally studied as an oral compound for gut healing), but most peptide supplements you see marketed online don't deliver what they promise.

                            At Moonshot, peptide therapy (sermorelin or PT-141) is $250/month, which includes the peptide from a licensed compounding pharmacy and medical oversight. Costs vary by provider and peptide. Insurance does not typically cover peptide therapy.

                    <p class="text-brand-slate font-light mb-4">
                        When most people think of progesterone, they think of pregnancy and fertility. That's fair—progesterone does prepare the uterine lining for implantation and supports early pregnancy. But reducing it to "the pregnancy hormone" misses the bigger picture.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-brand-slate font-light mb-4">
                        Progesterone has receptors throughout your brain and body. It affects your nervous system, your sleep architecture, your mood, and your sense of calm. When progesterone drops—whether from anovulatory cycles, perimenopause, or stress—the effects go far beyond fertility.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-brand-slate font-light">
                        Understanding progesterone is essential for understanding why you might feel anxious, sleep poorly, or feel "off" even when estrogen levels look fine.

                            <p class="text-brand-gray font-light">
                                Progesterone metabolizes into allopregnanolone, a neurosteroid that acts on GABA receptors—the same receptors targeted by anti-anxiety medications and alcohol. This is why progesterone has a natural calming, anti-anxiety effect. When progesterone drops, many women experience increased anxiety, irritability, and a feeling of being "on edge."

                            <p class="text-brand-gray font-light">
                                Through its GABA effects, progesterone promotes deeper, more restorative sleep. Women often notice sleep disturbances in the luteal phase (after ovulation) when progesterone should be high but isn't, and sleep problems are one of the first complaints in perimenopause when progesterone production becomes erratic.

                            <p class="text-brand-gray font-light">
                                Estrogen and progesterone work in opposition. Estrogen stimulates and builds; progesterone calms and sheds. Without adequate progesterone to balance estrogen, you can develop "estrogen dominance"—not necessarily high estrogen, but estrogen that's unopposed. This leads to heavy periods, breast tenderness, bloating, and mood swings.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-brand-gray font-light">
                                Estrogen causes the uterine lining to grow. Progesterone causes it to mature and shed in a controlled way. Without progesterone, the lining can become too thick (hyperplasia), which increases cancer risk over time. This is why women on estrogen therapy always need progesterone if they have a uterus.

                                Beyond its anti-anxiety effects, progesterone influences serotonin and other neurotransmitters. Low progesterone is associated with increased depression and mood volatility. Many women notice significant mood changes in the days before their period when progesterone drops sharply.

                                Progesterone is produced by the corpus luteum—the structure that forms after ovulation. No ovulation = no corpus luteum = no significant progesterone production. Anovulatory cycles are common with PCOS, high stress, under-eating, over-exercising, and in perimenopause.

                                Progesterone is the first hormone to decline in perimenopause—often years before estrogen drops. This is why perimenopausal symptoms often start with sleep issues, anxiety, and cycle changes rather than hot flashes. Many women in their late 30s and 40s have declining progesterone while estrogen remains normal or even high.

                                Cortisol (the stress hormone) and progesterone share a precursor: pregnenolone. Under chronic stress, your body prioritizes cortisol production over progesterone—a phenomenon sometimes called "pregnenolone steal." High stress literally diverts resources away from progesterone production.

                                Even when ovulation occurs, the corpus luteum may not produce adequate progesterone. This can result from poor follicle development, thyroid issues, or other factors. The result is a short luteal phase (less than 10 days) and low progesterone symptoms despite ovulating.

                    <p class="text-brand-slate font-light mb-4">
                        Timing matters enormously when testing progesterone. In cycling women, progesterone is only elevated in the luteal phase (after ovulation). Testing on day 3 of your cycle will show low progesterone because it's supposed to be low then.
                    </p>

                            For cycling women: Test progesterone 5-7 days after ovulation (approximately day 19-21 of a 28-day cycle, or 7 days before expected period).
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light">
                            For perimenopausal or menopausal women: Timing is less critical as cycles are irregular or absent. Random testing can still provide useful information.

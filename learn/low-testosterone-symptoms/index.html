                        <h3 class="font-bold text-lg mb-3">Fatigue & Low Energy</h3>
                        <p class="text-brand-slate text-sm font-light mb-3">
                            Not just "tired"—this is a persistent exhaustion that doesn't improve with sleep. You wake up tired, drag through the day, and lack the energy for activities you used to enjoy.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-brand-slate text-sm font-light">
                            <strong class="text-brand-dark">Why it happens:</strong> Testosterone affects mitochondrial function and red blood cell production. Low T means less cellular energy and potentially mild anemia.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-brand-slate text-sm font-light mb-3">
                            Noticeable decline in sexual interest. You're not thinking about sex, don't pursue it, and may feel indifferent even when the opportunity arises.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-brand-slate text-sm font-light">
                            <strong class="text-brand-dark">Why it happens:</strong> Testosterone is the primary driver of male libido. When levels drop, so does desire—it's physiological, not psychological.

                            Difficulty getting or maintaining erections. May include fewer morning erections, softer erections, or complete inability to achieve erection.

                        <p class="text-brand-slate text-sm font-light">
                            <strong class="text-brand-dark">Why it happens:</strong> Testosterone stimulates nitric oxide production needed for erections. Low T also reduces neural sensitivity. Note: ED has many causes—low T is just one.

                            Difficulty concentrating, poor memory, "fuzzy" thinking. Harder to stay focused at work. Forgetting things you normally wouldn't forget.

                        <p class="text-brand-slate text-sm font-light">
                            <strong class="text-brand-dark">Why it happens:</strong> Testosterone affects cognitive function, including memory and executive function. The brain has testosterone receptors throughout.
                        </p>

                            Getting weaker despite working out. Muscles feel smaller or softer. Harder to build or maintain muscle than it used to be.

                            <strong class="text-brand-dark">Why it happens:</strong> Testosterone is anabolic—it builds muscle. Low T shifts your body toward catabolism (breaking down tissue).

                        <p class="text-brand-slate text-sm font-light">
                            <strong class="text-brand-dark">Why it happens:</strong> Low testosterone increases fat storage and reduces fat burning. Fat cells also convert testosterone to estrogen, creating a negative cycle.

                            Irritability, depression, anxiety, lack of motivation. Feeling "flat" emotionally. Less drive and ambition than you used to have.

                            Insomnia, restless sleep, waking frequently, or sleep that doesn't feel restorative.

                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            Yes. Testosterone affects neurotransmitters involved in mood regulation. Many men diagnosed with depression actually have untreated low T. If antidepressants haven't fully helped, checking testosterone is worth considering.

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-brand-light mb-2">I'm in my 30s—can I have low T?</h3>
                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            Yes. While average testosterone declines with age, young men can have low T too. Poor sleep, chronic stress, obesity, certain medications, and underlying conditions can all cause low testosterone at any age.

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-brand-light mb-2">Is testosterone therapy safe?</h3>
                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            When properly monitored, testosterone therapy has a good safety profile. Regular monitoring of blood counts, PSA, and other markers helps catch and prevent potential issues. The risks of untreated low T (metabolic issues, bone loss, cardiovascular risk) are often greater than treatment risks.

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-brand-light mb-2">Will treatment affect my fertility?</h3>
                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            Standard TRT can suppress sperm production. If fertility is a concern, options like HCG or enclomiphene can help maintain fertility while addressing low T symptoms. This should be discussed before starting any treatment.

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-center">WHAT ARE HORMONE PELLETS?</h2>
                <p class="text-brand-slate font-light text-center mb-12 max-w-2xl mx-auto">
                    Bioidentical hormone pellets are small, solid cylinders—about the size of a grain of rice—custom-compounded with testosterone or estradiol and inserted just beneath the skin. They dissolve slowly over months, releasing a steady, consistent dose of hormones that mimics your body's natural rhythm.
                </p>

                <div class="grid md:grid-cols-3 gap-8">

                        <p class="text-brand-slate text-sm font-light">
                            The hormones are molecularly identical to what your body produces. Testosterone is derived from plant sources (yellow ginger), estradiol from yam or soy. These are not synthetic progestins or conjugated equine estrogens—they're the exact molecules your body recognizes.
                        </p>

                            Unlike injections that spike and crash, or creams that fluctuate with application timing, pellets release hormones steadily as they dissolve. This means consistent levels 24/7—no daily dosing, no hormonal roller coaster.
                        </p>

                <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-center mb-12 max-w-2xl mx-auto">
                    The pellets we use are manufactured in an FDA-registered 503B outsourcing facility and feature a patented formulation designed to solve the two biggest problems with traditional hormone pellets.
                </p>

                <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-8">

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-brand-light mb-3">Triamcinolone Acetonide</h3>
                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm mb-3">
                            The patented testosterone pellet formulation includes trace amounts of triamcinolone acetonide, a corticosteroid with well-established anti-inflammatory properties. In the context of pellet therapy, triamcinolone serves a specific purpose: reducing the inflammatory response at the insertion site.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm mb-3">
                            The result: less scar tissue formation, reduced post-procedure discomfort, and fewer pellet extrusions. In clinical observation, patients receiving pellets with triamcinolone experienced a greater than 50% reduction in extrusion rates compared to standard pellets—with male patients seeing a 75% reduction.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            Less scar tissue also means more consistent absorption over the life of the pellet, so you get steadier hormone levels from start to finish.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="bg-brand-dark p-6 rounded-sm">
                        <h3 class="font-bold text-brand-light mb-3">Controlled-Release Excipients</h3>
                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm mb-3">
                            The pellets use ethylcellulose as a rate-controlling excipient alongside stearic acid. This isn't just compressed hormone powder—it's an engineered matrix designed to dissolve at a controlled rate rather than releasing a large dose up front that tapers off.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm mb-3">
                            This means more consistent hormone levels throughout the entire lifecycle of the pellet, rather than a strong initial effect that fades before your next insertion.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            Patients report quicker initial symptom relief and more sustained results compared to standard compounded pellets.

                        <h3 class="font-bold mb-2">What if I don't like the effects—can pellets be removed?</h3>
                        <p class="text-brand-slate font-light text-sm">
                            Pellets can technically be removed, but it's not standard practice. Because dosing is based on comprehensive lab work and tailored to you, adverse reactions are uncommon. The more important safeguard is proper testing and conservative initial dosing—which is why we don't skip the lab work step.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="font-bold mb-2">What is pellet extrusion?</h3>
                        <p class="text-brand-slate font-light text-sm">
                            Extrusion is when a pellet works its way back out through the insertion site before fully dissolving. It's the most common complication of pellet therapy, but with the patented formulation we use (which includes triamcinolone to reduce scar tissue and inflammation), extrusion rates are well under 1%. Proper post-insertion care also helps—avoid strenuous lower body activity for 5 days.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="font-bold mb-2">Are pellets "bioidentical"?</h3>
                        <p class="text-brand-slate font-light text-sm">
                            Yes. The testosterone and estradiol in pellets are molecularly identical to the hormones your body produces. They're derived from plant sources (yellow ginger, yam, soy) through fermentation and chemical processing—not synthesized from horse urine (like Premarin) or created as synthetic analogs (like medroxyprogesterone). Your body can't tell the difference between these hormones and the ones it makes naturally.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-brand-slate font-light text-sm">
                            Avoid strenuous lower body exercise (squats, deadlifts, running) for about 5 days after insertion. Upper body training is fine. After 5 days, full activity with no restrictions. The pellets are placed deep enough in the subcutaneous tissue that normal activity won't dislodge them.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-brand-slate font-light text-sm">
                            For men, testosterone pellets (like all exogenous testosterone) can suppress sperm production. If fertility is a current priority, discuss this before starting. Options like HCG or enclomiphene can help maintain fertility. For women, hormone pellets are not a contraceptive and don't reliably prevent pregnancy—separate contraception should be used if needed.
                        </p>

                            The pellets contain no dairy and no animal-derived ingredients. While the starting materials include soy and yam, the sterols used are not proteins and are not classified as soy allergens. If you have known allergies, let your provider know and we'll review the full ingredient list with you.

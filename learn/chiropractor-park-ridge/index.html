                <p class="text-brand-slate font-light text-center mb-12 max-w-2xl mx-auto">
                    Most chiropractic offices are built on a maintenance model—keep you coming back indefinitely. Moonshot is built on the opposite: get you better and get you out.
                </p>

                <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-8">

                            Many chiropractic clinics lock you into long treatment plans with 3x/week adjustments for months. You feel temporary relief after each visit, but nothing changes long-term. The adjustment becomes the product—not the outcome.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-brand-slate text-sm font-light">
                            <strong class="text-brand-dark">The result:</strong> You stay dependent on adjustments instead of learning how to manage and resolve the problem yourself.

                                    Your first visit is not a quick crack-and-go. Dr. Gontarek takes 45-60 minutes to assess your movement patterns, pain behavior, medical history, and functional limitations. This is a full mechanical assessment—not a surface-level exam followed by a standard adjustment.

                                    Using the McKenzie Method, your pain is classified by how it responds to specific movements and positions. This tells us whether your problem is a derangement, dysfunction, or postural syndrome—and determines the exact treatment approach. No guesswork, no generic protocols.

                            Lower back pain is the most common reason patients visit. Whether it's acute (sudden onset) or chronic (lingering for months), the McKenzie assessment identifies the mechanical pattern driving your symptoms and the specific movements that reduce them.

                            Desk work, phone posture, and poor ergonomics are behind most neck pain. We address the root cause—not just the symptom—through mechanical assessment, manual therapy, and corrective exercises that create lasting change.

                            Cervicogenic headaches originate from neck dysfunction. When the cervical spine is the driver, chiropractic care is one of the most effective treatments. We identify whether your headaches have a mechanical origin and treat accordingly.

                            Pain radiating down the leg is often driven by a disc derangement in the lower spine. The McKenzie Method is particularly effective for sciatica—identifying the directional preference that centralizes and reduces radiating symptoms.

                            Shoulder, hip, and knee pain often have mechanical causes that respond to targeted manual therapy and corrective exercise. We assess the joint, identify contributing factors, and build a plan to restore function.

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-brand-light mb-2">What is the McKenzie Method and why does it matter?</h3>
                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            The McKenzie Method (Mechanical Diagnosis and Therapy) is an evidence-based assessment and treatment system for spinal and extremity pain. It classifies your pain by how it responds to specific movements, identifies the exercises that reduce your symptoms, and teaches you how to manage the problem independently. It's one of the most researched approaches in physical rehabilitation. <a href="/rehab/chiropractic/" class="text-brand-gray underline decoration-brand-gray/30 hover:decoration-brand-gray transition-colors">Learn more about our chiropractic approach</a>.

                            Most patients see significant improvement within 6-8 visits. Your first visit is a 45-60 minute comprehensive evaluation where Dr. Gontarek builds a clear treatment plan with defined milestones. The goal is to get you better and teach you how to stay better—not to schedule you for indefinite maintenance adjustments.

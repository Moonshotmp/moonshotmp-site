                                    Comprehensive movement assessment. Not a 5-minute screen -- a thorough evaluation of how you move, where you're restricted, what's weak, and what's compensating. Dr. Gontarek uses the McKenzie Method (MDT) classification system to identify the mechanical pattern driving your symptoms. This determines whether your issue is derangement, dysfunction, or postural -- and dictates the treatment direction from day one.

At Moonshot, every minute of your session is one-on-one with Dr. Gontarek. The tools above aren't a menu you pick from -- they're applied based on what your assessment indicates. Most patients improve within 6-8 visits because the care is focused, not diluted.

                            No. Illinois allows direct access to rehabilitation services without a physician referral. You can book your first appointment directly through our website. We'll perform a comprehensive movement assessment at your first visit and build a plan from there.

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-brand-light mb-2">Does Moonshot accept insurance for physical rehab?</h3>
                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            Yes. We accept BCBS PPO insurance for rehabilitation services. For patients with other insurance plans, we offer transparent cash pricing and provide superbills for out-of-network reimbursement. Many patients also use HSA or FSA funds.

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-brand-light mb-2">How many visits will I need?</h3>
                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            Most patients see meaningful improvement within 6-8 visits. The exact timeline depends on the nature and severity of your condition, how long it's been present, and how consistently you follow your home exercise program. Our goal is to build your independence -- not create long-term dependency on treatment.

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-brand-light mb-2">How is this different from a typical physical therapy clinic?</h3>
                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            Most PT clinics see 3-4 patients simultaneously, use techs and assistants for the majority of your visit, and rely heavily on passive modalities and generic exercise sheets. At Moonshot, every minute of your session is one-on-one with Dr. Gontarek. Treatment is hands-on, exercise is individualized and progressive, and outcomes are tracked objectively. You're not a number in a rotation.

                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            Your first visit includes a comprehensive movement assessment using the McKenzie Method classification system, a review of your history and goals, and hands-on treatment. You'll leave with a clear understanding of what's driving your symptoms, a treatment plan with a realistic timeline, and initial exercises to begin at home.

                    <p>
                        A trigger point is a hyperirritable spot within a taut band of skeletal muscle. If you've ever felt a tight "knot" in your neck, shoulder, or back that's painful to the touch and seems to send pain somewhere else when pressed, you've felt an active trigger point.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These aren't just tight muscles. Trigger points are localized areas where muscle fibers are stuck in sustained contraction at the microscopic level. The fibers can't release on their own because they're locked in an energy crisis: the contraction restricts local blood flow, oxygen drops, metabolic waste accumulates, and the muscle lacks the energy to let go. The result is a self-perpetuating cycle of contraction, ischemia, and pain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What makes trigger points distinctive is <strong>referred pain</strong>. Unlike a bruise or a strain that hurts right where the injury is, trigger points send pain to other areas of the body in consistent, well-mapped patterns. This is why so many people chase the wrong source for months. You treat where it hurts, but the pain generator is somewhere else entirely.
                    </p>

                        <strong class="text-brand-light">Why this matters:</strong> A trigger point in your upper trapezius can cause a headache. A trigger point in your infraspinatus can cause shoulder and arm pain that mimics a rotator cuff injury. A trigger point in your piriformis can cause sciatica-like symptoms down the leg. If you've been treated for the symptom location without relief, the actual source may be a trigger point referring pain to that area.

                            The most common trigger point location. Knots in the upper trap refer pain up the side of the neck and into the temple, causing tension headaches. If you get headaches that start at the base of your skull or behind your eye after long hours at a desk, upper trap trigger points are a likely culprit.

                            A rotator cuff muscle on the back of the shoulder blade. Trigger points here send deep, aching pain into the front and side of the shoulder and down the arm. This pattern is frequently mistaken for rotator cuff injury, frozen shoulder, or even biceps tendinitis.

                            Sustained, targeted pressure applied directly to the trigger point using thumb, finger, or elbow. The provider isolates the taut band, locates the nodule, and applies progressive pressure until the tissue releases. This is the foundation of trigger point therapy. It's more targeted and diagnostic than general massage because the provider is following specific referral patterns to find the source of your pain, not just working on the area that hurts.

                        <p class="text-brand-slate text-sm font-light">
                            A thin filiform needle is inserted directly into the trigger point to mechanically disrupt the contracted fibers. The needle breaks the contraction cycle at the motor endplate and often produces a <strong>local twitch response</strong>, a brief involuntary contraction that signals the trigger point has been hit and deactivated. Dry needling reaches deep trigger points that manual pressure can't fully access. It's especially effective for chronic, stubborn knots. <a href="/learn/dry-needling/" class="text-brand-slate underline decoration-brand-slate/30 hover:decoration-brand-slate transition-colors">Read our full dry needling guide</a>.

                        <p class="text-brand-slate text-sm font-light">
                            Specialized stainless-steel instruments are used to detect and treat soft tissue restrictions, fascial adhesions, and trigger points. The instrument amplifies the provider's ability to feel tissue texture changes and delivers targeted shear force to break up fibrotic tissue. IASTM works well for superficial trigger points, fascial restrictions surrounding the trigger point, and areas where the trigger point sits within a broader pattern of soft tissue dysfunction.

                        <p class="text-brand-slate text-sm font-light">
                            After the trigger point is deactivated, the muscle needs to be restored to its full resting length. Targeted stretching immediately after treatment locks in the release and prevents the fibers from re-contracting. Corrective exercises address the underlying cause: weak opposing muscles, poor posture, movement compensations. Treatment without follow-up rehab is a temporary fix. Treatment with corrective work is a lasting one.

The specific mix depends on what your tissue needs that day.

                                    Dr. Gontarek will take a detailed history of your pain: where it is, when it started, what makes it better or worse, and what you've already tried. Then he'll palpate the muscles, following the referral maps to trace your pain back to its source. When he finds the trigger point, you'll recognize it immediately because pressing on it will reproduce your familiar pain pattern. That "yes, that's it" moment is diagnostic.

                                    Based on what's found, the provider selects the appropriate technique or combination: manual pressure, dry needling, IASTM, or all three. Most patients describe the sensation as "good pain" or "hurts so good." It's a deep, satisfying ache that feels productive, not harmful. If dry needling is used, you may feel a brief twitch response. Treatment is more targeted and intense than a massage, but sessions are typically 20 to 30 minutes, not an hour.

                                    Many patients feel significant relief immediately after the session. The muscle feels looser, range of motion improves, and the referred pain diminishes or stops entirely. Some soreness at the treatment site is normal for 24 to 48 hours, similar to the feeling after a deep tissue massage. Drink water, move gently, and avoid heavy loading of the treated area for a day or two.

                                    Some patients resolve completely after one session. Chronic or recurring trigger points may need several sessions spaced 1 to 2 weeks apart. Your provider will also prescribe specific stretches and corrective exercises to address the root cause that created the trigger points: posture, movement patterns, workstation setup, or training load. The goal is to fix the problem, not create dependency on treatment.

                            Trigger points in the upper trapezius, suboccipitals, SCM, and temporalis are one of the most common causes of tension-type headaches. If your headaches start at the base of your skull, behind your eyes, or at your temples after desk work or stress, trigger point therapy can often reduce their frequency and intensity dramatically.

                            Desk work, phone use, and driving create chronic tension in the upper traps, levator scapulae, and scalenes. These trigger points cause stiffness, restricted range of motion, and pain that radiates into the arm or hand. This is the most common presentation we treat and one of the most responsive to trigger point therapy.

                            Jaw clenching and teeth grinding create trigger points in the masseter, temporalis, and medial pterygoid muscles. These refer pain to the teeth, ear, and temple and restrict mouth opening. Trigger point therapy to the masticatory muscles provides relief that a night guard alone often can't.

                            Trigger points in the QL, paraspinals, gluteus medius, and piriformis are frequent contributors to chronic low back and hip pain. These can mimic disc-related symptoms or SI joint dysfunction. Identifying the myofascial component often provides relief that imaging-guided interventions miss.

                            Not all sciatica comes from the spine. Piriformis trigger points can compress the sciatic nerve and send pain, tingling, or numbness down the leg. If your MRI is clean but you still have leg symptoms, a muscular trigger point may be the actual source.

                            Many patients feel significant relief after a single session. Chronic or deeply embedded trigger points may require several sessions spaced 1 to 2 weeks apart. Your provider will assess your response and adjust accordingly. The goal is resolution, not indefinite treatment.

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-brand-light mb-2">What's the difference between trigger point therapy and massage?</h3>
                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            Trigger point therapy is more targeted and clinical than general massage. A trained provider identifies the specific hyperirritable spots causing your pain pattern, then uses precise techniques to deactivate them. Massage addresses general muscle tension. Trigger point therapy diagnoses and treats the specific knots that refer pain to other areas. It's more intense, more focused, and typically produces faster results for specific pain complaints.

                            Most patients describe it as "good pain" or "hurts so good." When the provider presses on an active trigger point, you'll feel a deep ache and often recognize it as the source of your pain pattern. Dry needling may produce a brief local twitch response. The discomfort is temporary and is usually followed by immediate relief and improved range of motion.

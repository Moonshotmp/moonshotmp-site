Some people find the twitch uncomfortable but tolerable; others barely notice it. Soreness similar to a deep workout is common for 24–48 hours afterward."

                    <p>
                        Dry needling is a technique in which a thin, solid, monofilament needle is inserted directly into myofascial trigger points — hyperirritable spots within a taut band of skeletal muscle. The needle is "dry" because nothing is injected. There's no medication, no saline, no anesthetic. The needle itself is the treatment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These needles are extremely thin — typically 0.16 to 0.30 mm in diameter — and solid, not hollow like a hypodermic needle used for injections or blood draws. The filiform needles are the same type used in acupuncture, but that's where the similarity ends. Dry needling is rooted in modern Western neuroscience and musculoskeletal anatomy, not Traditional Chinese Medicine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The goal is specific: locate the dysfunctional trigger point, insert the needle, elicit a local twitch response, and reset the neuromuscular environment of that tissue. When it works — and there is a growing body of evidence that it does — the result is reduced pain, restored range of motion, and improved muscle function, often within a single session.

It uses similar needles, but the theoretical framework, point selection, treatment goals, and clinical training are entirely different. Dry needling targets identifiable musculoskeletal dysfunction.

                    <p>
                        A myofascial trigger point is not just a "knot." It's a localized area of muscle where the motor endplate is dysfunctional — stuck in a state of sustained contraction. The sarcomeres (the contractile units of muscle fibers) in the trigger point are maximally shortened, creating a palpable taut band. This contraction compresses local blood vessels, reducing oxygen delivery and waste removal, which creates a self-perpetuating cycle of dysfunction and pain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When the needle enters this tissue, several things happen in sequence:

                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            The needle mechanically disrupts the taut band, triggering an involuntary, rapid contraction of the muscle fibers — the local twitch response. This is both diagnostic and therapeutic. The LTR confirms you've hit the trigger point, and the contraction itself begins the process of releasing the sustained shortening. Research by Simons and Hong demonstrated that eliciting the LTR is a key predictor of treatment success.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            The biochemical milieu of a trigger point is measurably different from normal tissue. Shah et al. (2008) demonstrated that active trigger points contain elevated concentrations of substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), bradykinin, serotonin, norepinephrine, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Acetylcholine levels at the dysfunctional motor endplate are abnormally high, maintaining the sustained contraction. The needle disrupts this chemical environment, normalizing the concentrations of these nociceptive and inflammatory mediators.

                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            The sustained contraction in a trigger point compresses capillaries, creating local ischemia (reduced blood flow). The twitch response and subsequent relaxation of the taut band restores blood flow to the area, bringing oxygen and nutrients while flushing accumulated metabolic waste products — the same substances that were sensitizing local nociceptors and perpetuating the pain cycle.

                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            Needle insertion activates A-delta and C nerve fibers, which triggers a cascade of endogenous pain-modulating mechanisms. This includes segmental inhibition (gate control theory — the needle stimulus "closes the gate" to pain signals at the spinal cord level), activation of the descending inhibitory pain pathway from the periaqueductal gray matter, and release of endogenous opioids including enkephalins and beta-endorphins. The result is both local and systemic pain reduction.

                            By disrupting the dysfunctional motor endplate and normalizing the chemical environment, dry needling effectively resets the neuromuscular feedback loop. The muscle can return to its normal resting length and normal contractile function. This is why patients often notice an immediate improvement in range of motion — the mechanical restriction has been released at the tissue level.

                            The micro-trauma from needle insertion initiates a controlled inflammatory and healing response. The body sends platelets, growth factors, and fibroblasts to the needle site. This is similar to the concept behind other micro-trauma therapies (like microneedling for skin or shockwave therapy for tendons) — a small, controlled injury that stimulates the body's own repair mechanisms to address tissue that was stuck in a dysfunctional state.

                        Dry needling is a hands-on, clinician-driven procedure. There's no machine doing the work. The practitioner's skill in palpation, anatomy knowledge, and needling technique determines the outcome. Here's what the process looks like:
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="mt-8 space-y-6">

                                The session begins with a focused assessment. The clinician identifies the involved muscles based on your symptoms, movement patterns, and pain distribution. You'll be positioned to allow access to the target muscles while keeping you comfortable — this varies depending on the area being treated. For upper trapezius work, you might be seated or prone. For piriformis, you'll likely be side-lying.

                                This is the most important step. The clinician uses flat palpation or pincer palpation to locate the taut band within the muscle, then identifies the most hyperirritable point within that band — the trigger point. A skilled practitioner can feel the difference between normal tissue, a taut band, and an active trigger point. The palpation itself often reproduces the patient's familiar pain pattern, confirming the correct target.

                                The clinician uses a guide tube or direct insertion to advance the needle through the skin and into the trigger point. Two primary techniques are used:

This technique is designed to elicit multiple local twitch responses and thoroughly disrupt the dysfunctional tissue. It's the most common technique for deep trigger points.

                                Needle depth varies significantly depending on the muscle group. Superficial muscles like the upper trapezius or temporalis may require only 10-15 mm of depth. Deep muscles like the gluteus medius, piriformis, or multifidus may require 40-60 mm or more. The clinician's anatomical knowledge is critical — knowing what structures lie beneath the needle path at every depth.

                                A typical session lasts 15 to 30 minutes. The number of trigger points treated in a single session depends on the patient's tolerance, the severity of the condition, and whether it's a first session or a follow-up. First sessions are typically more conservative — treating 4 to 8 points — to gauge the patient's response and soreness levels. Experienced patients and follow-up sessions may address more points.

Using microdialysis needles inserted into active trigger points, they measured the biochemical environment before and after dry needling. They demonstrated that active trigger points contain significantly elevated levels of inflammatory and nociceptive chemicals — and that eliciting a local twitch response normalizes these concentrations toward baseline. This was the first direct biochemical evidence explaining why dry needling works.

                        <strong class="text-brand-light">Neither is "better" in an absolute sense</strong> — they're different tools with different paradigms. But if your problem is a palpable trigger point in your upper trapezius that's causing headaches and restricting your neck range of motion, dry needling targets that specific pathology directly. The needle goes into the dysfunctional tissue because the tissue is dysfunctional — not because it sits on a meridian line.

                                <strong class="text-brand-dark">Needle insertion:</strong> The needle passing through the skin is often barely felt — many patients say they didn't know the needle was in until the twitch response happens. The filiform needle is thin enough that the insertion is less painful than a standard blood draw or injection.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong class="text-brand-dark">The twitch response:</strong> This is what you'll feel. When the needle hits the trigger point, the muscle will visibly and involuntarily contract — a quick, localized twitch or jump. It feels like a brief deep cramp or a flick inside the muscle. It lasts a fraction of a second but can be startling the first time. Some patients describe it as uncomfortable but not painful; others feel a deep aching or cramping sensation that resolves within seconds.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong class="text-brand-dark">Multiple points:</strong> The clinician will typically treat several trigger points in a session, moving between muscles based on your presentation. Some twitches will be stronger than others depending on the irritability of the trigger point.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong class="text-brand-dark">Immediate effects:</strong> Many patients notice increased range of motion and reduced pain immediately after the needles are removed. You may feel a sense of heaviness or relaxation in the treated area — the muscle has just released a sustained contraction it may have been holding for weeks or months.

                                <strong class="text-brand-dark">Soreness (24-48 hours):</strong> Post-treatment soreness is normal and expected. It feels like the deep soreness you get after a hard workout — not sharp pain, but a dull ache in the treated muscles. This is the result of the micro-trauma and local inflammatory response that's part of the healing process. It typically resolves within 24 to 48 hours.

                                <strong class="text-brand-dark">Bruising:</strong> Some bruising is possible, particularly in areas with more superficial blood vessels or in patients who bruise easily. Minor bruising is cosmetic and resolves on its own within a few days.
                            </p>

                                <strong class="text-brand-dark">Fatigue:</strong> Some patients feel a general sense of fatigue or relaxation after treatment, especially after the first session. This is a normal systemic response to the neurophysiological changes triggered by the treatment.

                                <strong class="text-brand-dark">Improved range of motion:</strong> Increased range of motion and reduced pain are often noticeable the same day. Full therapeutic benefit typically builds over 2-3 sessions as the treated muscles maintain their restored length and the neuromuscular system recalibrates.

                        <strong class="text-brand-light">Post-treatment recommendations:</strong> Stay hydrated, move gently through the day (don't immobilize the treated area), and apply heat rather than ice if the area feels sore. Avoid intense exercise targeting the treated muscles for 24 hours. The goal is to let the muscle settle into its new, restored resting state.

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-brand-light mb-2">Is dry needling painful?</h3>
                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            Most patients describe the needle insertion itself as barely noticeable — the needles are extremely thin (0.16-0.30 mm), much thinner than a hypodermic needle. What you will feel is the local twitch response: a brief, involuntary muscle contraction that can feel like a deep cramp or a flick inside the muscle. It lasts a fraction of a second. Some people find the twitch uncomfortable but tolerable; others barely notice it. Soreness similar to a deep workout is common for 24-48 hours afterward.

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-brand-light mb-2">How many sessions will I need?</h3>
                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            It depends on the condition, how long it's been present, and how your body responds. Acute issues may resolve in 2-4 sessions. Chronic conditions like long-standing myofascial pain or tension headaches often require 4-8 sessions over several weeks, sometimes with periodic maintenance. Many patients notice improvement after the first or second session — especially in range of motion and pain reduction.

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-brand-light mb-2">Who is qualified to perform dry needling?</h3>
                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            Licensing varies by state. In most states, dry needling can be performed by physical therapists, chiropractors, and medical doctors who have completed specific postgraduate training in the technique. Training typically involves coursework in musculoskeletal anatomy, trigger point identification, needling technique, and safety protocols, plus supervised clinical hours. Always verify that your provider has completed accredited dry needling training.

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-brand-light mb-2">Can dry needling be combined with other treatments?</h3>
                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            Yes — and it often works best that way. Dry needling is frequently combined with manual therapy, corrective exercise, chiropractic adjustments, and rehabilitation protocols. The needling resets the dysfunctional tissue, and the complementary treatments reinforce proper movement patterns and address underlying biomechanical issues. At Moonshot, dry needling is part of an integrated rehab and recovery approach, not a standalone treatment.

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-brand-light mb-2">Is dry needling covered by insurance?</h3>
                        <p class="text-brand-gray font-light text-sm">
                            Coverage varies by insurance plan and state. Some insurance plans cover dry needling when performed by a licensed provider (such as a physical therapist or chiropractor) as part of a treatment plan for a diagnosed condition. Others do not. It is increasingly recognized, but coverage is not universal. Check with your insurance provider for specifics. At Moonshot, we can help you understand your options.

                            Yes. Dry needling is generally not performed on patients with bleeding disorders or who are on anticoagulant therapy (without medical clearance), patients with needle phobia that would prevent tolerating the procedure, areas with active skin infection or open wounds, patients who are immunocompromised (relative contraindication), or directly over implants or prostheses. Pregnancy is a relative contraindication for certain areas. Your provider will screen for these before treatment.
